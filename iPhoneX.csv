iphone x,"FRAUD - Its not Fully Unlocked - Its locked.his Description says its a FULLY unlocked I-phone X, when we bought 3 months ago. it works fine in the USA but when we brought it to Indonesian it is LOCKED! We couldn't test till we left the country and the Seller will not respond. THIS IS FRAUD! We cant use it for its stated purpose and it couldn't be tested till you left the USA. we just need the code to unlock it. My friend just won $3000 in a court case in Cleveland suing Apple over the same issue. I guess thats our next step if no reply.

iphone x,"Totally satisfied! The best phone great pics.Totally satisfied ! The best phone great pics, fast and easy to use. An upgrade from the iphone 7"
iphone x,"
One month of regular use / covered in scratches. I want to start out by saying that Iâ€™m a binge Apple â€œfanboyâ€ and own more Apple products then an average consumer.

My first impressions with the iPhone X are great despite to some annoying OS bugs and I would highly recommend the phone. The full screen OLED display is killer and itâ€™s a must experience.

My main compliant is that my screen has a ton of scratches on it after a month of a regular use. I work in the office and I keep my phone in my pocket like most of us do. To be homesbe, my iPhkne 6s has resisted scratches for over 2 years and the X started showin scratches within the first few weeks. This is a huge disappointment and it takes away from the beautiful experience of the display. #disapointed"
iphone x,"Five Stars. 
No bad"
iphone x,"Beautiful phone with one annoying flaw. came from the 7+ which I absolutely loved but died on me after 1.5 years making the conspiracy of Apple devices intentionally slowing down and becoming hard to use plausible.

Given that, I took the plunge and since needing a phone, went with the â€œfuture proofâ€ X. It was between the 8+ or X but given the display on the X I made the move. Do I regret it?

Pros:

Amazing display
Exceptionally fast
Beautiful design and form factor (bigger display but smaller form is very helpful)
Videos are outstanding
Camera is world class and photos amazing
Wireless charging very helpful

Cons:

Face ID works but is much slower than fingerprint sensor and a little annoying

Battery life is ok, not great, but not on par with 8+

Heats up due to glass back when doing any processes that require it

Design is beautiful but glass back makes it incredibly slippery requiring a case to hide that design

Let me just say that despite itâ€™s amazing display, I should have gone with the 8+. The Face ID is just not on par with fingerprint sensor. It works, but requires the extra step of swiping up after looking at it. Maybe Iâ€™m just being way too picky but when you are used to just placing your thumb and opening instantly every time, itâ€™s the one thing they just drives me crazy.

You get used to the other gestures but again, just not as simple as using the 7 or 8.

Would I buy it again? Probably not especially at the cost and extra $250 vs the 8+ which doesnâ€™t have the screen of the X but pretty much everything else. While maybe not a big deal to some, I just canâ€™t get past the Face ID being more of a gimmick then a necessity and I fear thatâ€™s the future of all iPhones like removal of the headphone jack."
iphone x,"starsAmazing, Stupendous Phone. Full disclosure, I bought my iPhone X yesterday at ATT. It is not the unlocked one, but as someone who was hesitant to make the switch, I wanted to write a review. I never get the latest and greatest technology. I always waited and go the ""s"" version of the new iPhone. But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price, a few negative reviews, and to be honest, the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever. I am so glad I did. This phone is amazing.

Highlights: Great battery life. On my old iPhone, a 6s, I could get about 4 hours of moderate use before I had to charge, maybe 2 hours of heavy use. I went all day with moderate to heavy use and used less than 50% of my battery. The screen is as beautiful as all the people say. I have found many of my apps have already been updated to take advantage of the screen. The new gestures are very intuitive and in less than 12 hours I was completely used to them. Facial recognition is fast and I haven't had a single issue. I am terrible at taking pictures and this phone makes me look like I know what I am doing. Though there are a lot of setting options, they are really easy to navigate through. They say this is the best
smartphone ever, and I have to agree.

Negatives: Because this is so expensive, you might be a little overprotective. And you should be. But on my wireless plan, it only increased my payment about $8 month. I don't find that to really be a negative. I haven't found anything I don't like about this phone yet.

iphone x,really spiffy. nice phone
iphone x,Five Stars.Amazing
iphone x,Five Stars. Love it
iphone x,"Dear Apple

Dear Apple,

I was out of the country with my family on vacation when my phone got a few water drops on it and completely shut off and stopped working. At this moment, I was very upset with my phone and with Apple, but I was hopeful that I would be helped when I got back in the states. Fast forward a few days later, obviously very tough days being out of the country without a working phone, and I finally got off a plane and went straight to an apple store. Going into the apple store, I was very willing to share my story with the employees and the manager. How can Apple say a phone is water resistant up to 3 feet when it can break when it gets a few drops of water on it? I told the employees this, and they did not seem surprised at all. They basically told me it was my fault the phone broke, and I argued with them saying that apple false advertised. The employees wouldnt do much to help me, I was leaving for college the next day and needed a phone, they wanted me to pay 1,000$ for a new phone. The employees were unwilling to help, so was the manager. My experience with the Iphone X and apple in general has just been terrible. I am super fed up with apple and I really cannot believe how poorly I was treated. I have had an Iphone for the last 8 years, and the service has always been okay, but now Apple made a false claim and somehow that was my fault and I needed to pay for it. I still love the products Apple makes but I am fed up with the service and the treatment and the dishonesty."
iphone x,"For $1,200 it should work - didn't. Bought the iPhone X and immediately had problems with it. The unit wouldn't recognize cellular data, even after set-up via wifi. Ran all the tests and then reformatted it. Still nothing. Using a news reader app on wifi shouldn't take that much power, but after 10 minutes the phone was so hot I could barely hold it. Kudos to the Apple store for excellent customer service, though. For $1,200 it should work straight out of the box. It didn't. I'm not going to waste time with troubleshooting or a new one. That money is now back in my pocket."
iphone x,Three Stars.It was good
iphone x,"Would be five stars except for screen being too fragile. I bought my iPhone X from Apple, so I'm not shown as a verified purchaser by Amazon. I'd rate it 5 stars except the screen developed a hairline crack just two months after I got it even though it's never been dropped. Apple, of course, will not do anything about that since they only have my word that it hasn't been dropped. It has been in my pocket much of the time and, with that big screen, it may have stressed the screen a bit when I sat down, etc. But the screen should be able to withstand minor stresses like that! Even worse, four months later, it developed a second hairline crack, again without ever being dropped. Right now, the phone is 100% usable since I have to look very carefully to see the hairline crack, and can only see it (just barely) with a totally black screen. But I worry that this is going to get worse. I hope I am an unusual case, but found a couple of other complaints here about ""screen lifting"" and similar. It seems like Apple needs to improve the screen durability.

Other than this issue, I love the phone. The screen is big, especially compared to the physical dimensions. When my Kindle broke recently (I left it on a chair and sat on it â€“ not wise!), instead of buying a new one I started using my iPhone X to read Kindle books. I like it even better than my old Kindle Voyage. The screen is a bit smaller, but much sharer and brighter. And ""my Kindle"" is always with me!

Camera is great, but you know that and much more from reviews. Mostly I wanted to register my concern about the screen and, if others experience the same problem, maybe Apple will respond."
iphone x,"Great Phone but NOT evolutionary! A bit overpriced for the value.Late last year Apple released their iPhone X, the 10th generation iPhone and the flagship of their line-up. When it was first announced in September 2017, there was a lot of media coverage and many people were excited for it to go on sale. It was possibly the largest change to an iPhone the world had seen, and I had to get it. Sadly, I missed the online pre-order date, therefore I ended up on the second floor of the Galleria Mall parking garage at 10:30 pm wrapped in a sleeping bag on a lawn chair. After an 11hr and 33-minute wait, I finally was able to hand Apple $1400 for the phone. But was it worth it? I love the software and user interface apple generally produces. However, for the price I paid for this phone I expected it to have a bit more of a â€˜Wow-factorâ€™, in terms of the â€˜evolutionaryâ€™ technology that the device was advertised to possess. I do think that this device is a platform for them to build a lot of new and innovative technology off of, however, despite my excitement for that, the reality is that I spent a lot of money on an iPhone that doesnâ€™t do that much more than the previous generation. The features I enjoy include: the new Face ID biometric security feature, the beautiful OLED edge-to-edge display, the incredible camera quality, wireless charging and water-proof feature. That being said I donâ€™t think this phone was worth the price, much more the iPhone 8 and not significantly better.
Donâ€™t get me wrong, I do love the device, just as much as a love most products apple produces. When it comes to value however, value defined as the worth of something compared to the price paid or asked for it, I am not sure if I consider this item to be of good value. Initially, when I saw the launch event followed by the numerous exhilarating, colorful, dynamic ads I was under the impression that this phone would provide new user experiences using the augmented reality (AR) technology built in to the device.
The camera is just as good, if not better than I expected it to be and I often find myself in a dilemma due to the incredible quality, I no longer need to carry around my professional DSLR camera. Face ID: the new facial biometric scanner in the iPhone X is astonishing. It projects 30,000 invisible dots on your face, mapping the 3D dimensions which creates a high security level, despite some negative criticism the system has gotten. The phones new edge-to-edge OLED display is the most beautiful display Iâ€™ve seen on an iPhone, with high ranges of crisp colors and incomparable resolution. I am a sailor so I am at sea a lot, and near bodies of water. Having the iPhone X be waterproof has been a long-awaited feature for me and I really feel more comfortable having that feature. Wireless charging is an emerging technology that is interesting to me, although it isnâ€™t any more convenient than plugging in a cord, or even less convenient in some ways I had to buy the wireless charging pad just due to my interest in new technology. However, I do often find myself plugging in the cord so that I can use the phone while itâ€™s charging.
I am a huge fan of apple and an avid iPhone user, however when it comes to value I just donâ€™t think this phone was worth the $1400 I paid for it and the 12 hours wait in line. There are some features I love such as the great Camera, Face ID, the display and the waterproofing but I expected much more off of the AR capabilities and â€˜evolutionary technologyâ€™ that this phone was advertised to have. Who knows, maybe this really is a platform for them to build something really great off of, time will tell but in about 8 months the next iPhone will come out and mine will become outdated yet again. Currently, I donâ€™t feel I have gotten the value out of the device that I expected upon buying it."
iphone x,"Worst phone Iâ€™ve ever had.olor: SilverSize: 64 GB
You expect for +1000 for it to at least do basic functions like connect to WiFi but canâ€™t even do that. At least once a day the Bluetooth/ WiFi antennae stops working and the phone will crash, you have to turn it completely off. Not to mention all the other problems like the fact that native iPhone apps crash even 9 months after the release. Also noticed it becoming much slower. Needless to say I will no longer be purchasing iPhones."
iphone x,"iPhone X - A Phone From the Future.iPhone X â€“ A phone from the future
Making the jump from the iPhone 7 plus to the iPhone X was a big decision to begin with, how much could change in just one year? Well to the surprise of many (or maybe not) Apple once again crushed this phone. All of the enticing new tricks and treats tucked inside this amazing looking phone was everything Apple users hoped for and more. To review this product all of the following will be taken into account, innovation, battery-life, design, durability, cost, and operating system.

To begin, the ideal user that would buy this phone would be someone with an interest in technological innovation, an overdue upgrade for their current phone, or someone with the desire to just experience what Apple truly stands for, â€œto design the best personal computers in the world.â€ One of the only downsides that you may experience with this phone is the price tag. Ringing up at $1,132.00 for the 64 GB and $1,296.96 for the 256 GB may leave a dent in your wallet. Excluding the price tag on this sleek and attractive phone, it is perfect for a user who is constantly checking, or on their device. With the new adaptions to the iPhone X you will now be able to implement the seamless opening and surfing of apps with face recognition as well as fluid finger swipes. Even while boasting these streamlined new tools, the iPhone X also holds a 19.5-hour battery life. Almost double the battery life of the previous iPhone 7. So, if youâ€™re a business man or woman, student, or avid technology guru, you will be pleased with the care and effort put forth into making this phone one of a kind.

Moving on to the design and innovations of the phone. You will now be able to unlock your phone with the most unique thumbprint of all, your face. This allows for easy unlocking, as well, it can be used to make purchases and log onto various apps or websites while surfing the internet. Along with this is the removal of the home button. Though it took a while to get use to this change, overall it was a positive step forward. To get home on your phone now you simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen, quick and easy. Following the patterns of innovation stated above, the new iPhone X carries a dual 12MP sensor array as well as improved aperture and wide angle lens that is supported by image stabilization. This makes for perfect pictures, all the time. Not to mention the video capabilities have improved to include 60p 4k video recording, allowing for some of the best phone recorded videos ever. For the interiors of the phone, Apple has increased the RAM on the phone up to 3GB, allowing the iPhone X to be one of the fastest phones on the market.

When it comes to durability and cost, you may be a touch disappointed, though it must be pointed out. With the front and back of the iPhone X being glass, one drop will lead to a pricy fix (upwards of $700). Though the glass is now better quality and more durable, a drop can lead to serious costs. Some would argue that the price tag on this phone should alleviate some accidental drop costs but with quality comes price. With the potential for a costly drop, you are able to buy a case along with newly designed durable screen cover that can save you from the $700 down the road.

In conclusion, this is the best phone you would be able to purchase at this time when considering reliability, innovation, and usability. Apple once again did a fantastic job designing this phone and if youâ€™re on the fence about the purchase there are many options to upgrade or a 2-year payment plan with built in AppleCare. Overall this could be the phone that changes your perception of what a phone is and what a phone can do."
iphone x,iPhone X Defect.My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I donâ€™t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as Iâ€™ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesnâ€™t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because itâ€™s a Saturday and heâ€™s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didnâ€™t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe thatâ€™s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since itâ€™s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and Iâ€™ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. Iâ€™ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and Iâ€™ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far Iâ€™d have to say Iâ€™m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple. Hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th. To be continued...
iphone x,OVERPRICE. overprice.... more expensive than the new Iphone.. crazy
iphone x,"Irreplaceable fragile glass back unacceptable. Not a fan of the fragile glass back which costs 550 dollars and a complete disassembly/chassis replacement to fix. That is a massive design failure by making something that should be user replaceable such as the iPhone 4s back. Now Iâ€™m left with a shattered phone which canâ€™t be fixed. Itâ€™s a good thing I have a phone case to stop me from cutting my hands, otherwise it would be a safety hazard. FYI, this happened with my case on. If you choose to have Apple fix this issue they will be replacing the entire phone which is environmentally irresponsible and greedy by pocketing 160 of that 550 you paid.

Besides that this is a solid phone comparatively, I do like the stainless steel frame over their aluminum from the past but wish that I could omit wireless charging and have the stainless steel material throughout."
iphone x,"iphone X - Too many cons for me,  have had the x for sometime now. I can say that of all the iphones, the x is my biggest disappointment. I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc. This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off. I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue. Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues. Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects??? It's more than that. I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy. The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan. The face recognition is awful. I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern. If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off. A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it. These are all legit concerns. Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done. I am truly disappointed. I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine. The x by far being the most complaints with hardware issues. Save your money and get the 8 or maybe try another brand but do not waste your money on the x."
iphone x,One Star. did not work as planned it was a fraud
iphone x,Great but go to these places to get cheaper. 
iphone x,It sucks.  was about to buy this phone but I had a couple of friends to buy this and they said it was very horrible so i have second thoughts so i would like to sample this phone before I buy it
iphone x,"Sometimes, my iPhone X can not be unlocked with .... sometimes, my iPhone X can not be unlocked with the face ID, persistently, i.e. no matter how I look at the phone. When this happens, it can not be shutdown either. I must enter the pass-code to unlock. Once it is unlocked with the pass-code, the face ID will work for awhile to unlock the phone."
iphone x,"Promote. would like to promote your iPhone X on my next YouTube video
"
iphone x,"I want to promote this product. Hi, I do YouTube and I would love to promote this product"
iphone x,GLITCHES. The iPhone X is not a good phone. Glitches all the time.
iphone x,"iPhone X
It's very awesome."
iphone x,Quality Problems with the iPhone X.just bought an iPhone X for my son in college to replace his iPhone 7+. He called us tonight but the speakerphone quality was horrible. He could hear us fine but it sounded like he was underwater (it was too difficult to understand him so we hung up early). I am quite sure it was not a signal issue as we speak with him every Sunday from his apartment with good signal (AT&T). My advice is to take your time ordering in case it is a hardware defect that cannot be solved by a software update. Hopefully it is the latter given what I paid for it.
iphone x,Own the future of smartphones NOW. Upgraded from an iPhone 8 Plus. Must say it took some time getting used to the X but I love it. FaceID has worked well over 80 % of the time for me. The OLED screen is beautiful. The notch is not noticeable after you get used to it and distinguishes the iPhone.
iphone x,... wait to be apart of history by owning this GREAT phone! I cant wait to be apart of history by owning this GREAT phone!
iphone x,"Four Stars. 
I would like to test the product to see how well it works."
iphone x,One Star. I want it for freee
iphone x,"Itâ€™s terrible.
This thing stinks"
iphone x,"The IPhone X is no good ""0"".horrible, I sent mine back days after I received mine, ok 1st of all, who would purchase a phone for $1000+ you have to be dumb to buy one, I'm either hoping the 8 is better or I'm getting Samsung which was my 1st thought but then thought about Apple, obviously Apple didn't work out"
iphone x,Not a New iPhone Beware.It wasnâ€™t new. The serial number in the phone and on the box did not match.
iphone x,Not legit. Was a blacklisted phone. Serial number didnâ€™t match the box!!!! Returned for refund.
iphone x,"This iphone X is not brand NEW, it has ...This iphone X is not brand NEW, it has original apple ID with the phone, Cant load some App from Apple store."
iphone x,Three Stars.Great product but beware you will pay the Taxes if you ship it overseas.
iphone x,"Best iPhone ever.Apple did a great job with this phone. The screen is amazing and astonishing. How it covers the whole front of the phone and the quality of colors is just amazing.
I does take a while to get accustomed to the new gestures like going to home, and switching apps, and specially unlocking the phone if you've been using TouchID for several years, but it's worth it.
I love FaceID because it's incredibly accurate, natural, and fast. It gives the impression that your phone has no access code because it's so fast to unlock it, but you can rest assured that it really is protected, and nobody can access it.
And of course the OS is great. Apple's iOS is very easy to use, very powerful, and user friendly.
