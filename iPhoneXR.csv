iPhone Model,Reviews
Iphone xr,"Impressed.The phone is speedy, and the battery life is excellent (mostly LTE connections during the day; at night, Verizon service at my house is awful and the phone runs over WiFi calling... now, this has no bearing on the phone itself, but this is the basis of my battery life comments.) I love the screen. "
Iphone xr,"Great Phone at a ""Reasonable"" Price. the XS has better technology in the screen and the dual lens system, but this phone (the XR) has an awesome screen that looks great, the camera is sensational (for a smartphone), and the additional screen real estate given the removal of the home button and the bezel-to-bezel screen is awesome. The phone is actually just a hair smaller than the 7+ we replaced and the screen is significantly larger. The phone is fast, face ID works well, and we are overall very pleased with this phone. If you love your Apple devices (or, more specifically, mobile devices that run iOS), prefer a large screen with newer technology, but do not want to pay a premium price, this is probably the best phone for you. You also have a choice of colors, which is pretty cool!"
Iphone xr,Camera technology is poor quality. The cameras were great and the screen was ideal for traveling. The battery life is incredible. The speaker sound is loud and crisp. Had no issues with Bluetooth connectivity to my vehicle. The issue I just couldnâ€™t get past was the camera technology. The zoom on the back camera is truly disappointing. Apple should not have released this phone with this camera technology. The front camera during FaceTime calls is grainy and so is the picture you view of the person you are talking to. Just had my carrier issue me a return label. I would not recommend to a friend.
Iphone xr,"Good solid phone. Phone is beautiful but the only downside is that itâ€™s glass front and back therefore you want a case.

Iphone xr,"Upgraded from 7+ Good Move. I had a 7+ and upgraded to the XR. So far so good. Iâ€™ve had it a week and battery life is great, screen size is great. It took about 2 days to get completely used to no longer having a home button, but now itâ€™s no big deal. 

I really like swiping left/right at the bottom of the screen for recently used apps instead of double tapping the home button on my 7+. Also, and this is a big plus for me, this phone has a bigger screen but feels much smaller in my pocket. I have a case on it and it feels like my 7+ did in my pocket without a case. I sometimes go looking for my XR because I canâ€™t tell itâ€™s actually in my pocket. 

Thatâ€™s a nice upgrade.

Also, the camera on this phone is amazing. I was worried going from the dual camera on the 7+ to a single camera but I have no regrets. Iâ€™m not a professional photographer by any means but I can spot a good picture and I have to say the camera on the XR is really good. Low light is no problem, colors are still very bright."
Iphone xr,"Great phone upgrade. I love this new iPhone XR 128 GB in white. For the past five years, I had been using the iPhone 5s. We looked at models from the 7 to XS, but never felt excited enough to get one. When the XR was released, I was excited for such a nice phone at a good price. 

The phone feels fast, takes great pictures and videos, and has a nice fit in my hands. FaceID seems to work pretty well. And the battery life has been outstanding. I was just at a national park for a week, and only had to recharge every other day. 

Based on my experience thus far, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade from an iPhone 5 to 8, or anyone who doesnâ€™t care about OLED and doesnâ€™t need optical zoom on their phone."
Iphone xr,"Great iPhone. Every thing about this iPhone is great. I upgraded from iPhone 6 , this is a bit bigger between the Xs and Xs max . So if you donâ€™t like a bigger phone itâ€™s not for you. First the battery life is excellent last the whole day and next morning. The camera is really great. As for the screen resolution donâ€™t listen to the critics itâ€™s excellent. If youâ€™re upgrading from an iPhone 6 through 8 youâ€™ll wonâ€™t notice any difference. If you are using an oled display phone you will notice some but not much. And itâ€™s not a budget iPhone the critics labeled as such not Apple. it has 90 percent of 
What the Xs Has . If you can check it out at Best Buy or your phone carrier do so"
Iphone xr,"Love My New XR. It was time for a new iPhone. I preordered the XR and picked it up a week later. I've had it just four days but so far I absolutely am loving this phone. The face id is so cool and operating the phone is very easy. It's larger then my old phone and heavier but still comfortable to hold and carry. One item worth noting is there were a few apps that were hung up showing ""loading"" because of their size they would not load without using wi fi. I decided I didn't want them and deleted them. I recommend getting a glass screen cover and a sturdy case since I understand the repair cost is incredibly expensive."
Iphone xr,"Easy to use and understand! All the great aspects of iphone put into a more flawless and easier to use phone. The commands and swipes are effortless and smooth, the graphics and screen are stunning, and the sound is beautiful. My only issue (if you can call it that) is the size. Itâ€™s significantly larger than my old iphone 6s so itâ€™s more difficult to use one-handed but I also have small hands so this wonâ€™t be a problem for everyone. Overall itâ€™s every bit as exciting as Apple has made it out to be!!"
Iphone xr,"I really like this phone. I had been reading about the XR for about a month or so, and thought this hit the sweet spot of having most of the functions of the more expensive XS and XS Max at a better price. Coming from a 7 Plus, I have no issue with the screen, and I never used 3D touch a lot, so I don't really miss it. I think the pictures are just fine, plus having more colors for the XR tipped the scales for me toward it."
Iphone xr,"Great phone. The big switch from android to Apple was made easy with this Xr phone - so intuitive. Best Buy did a great job of moving all my info from my old phone for free and giving me tips about the new phone. Two weeks in and Iâ€™m loving my new phone, especially â€œHeh, Siri,â€ which is great for making hands free calls while driving to anyone in my contact list. Pictures great too."
Iphone xr,"Phones are us.... Great job by Best Buy staff. They were professional, courteous, and on task. We needed an upgrade on phones and they transitioned us quickly and competently. The only time consumer was transferring info from the old phone to the new phone (which is a normal timely procedure). The update was smooth and seamless. Hats off for a job well done."
Iphone xr,"So much screen. I love the size. Great in between size from the xs and xs max. Love how quick it is. The battery lasts almost twice as long as my 7 did. That alone is worth the upgrade. Screen resolution is great and the bezel isnâ€™t as bad as people made it sound. With a 128 gig, I have room for all the movies I want now too."
Iphone xr,great $ for an iphone. My last I phone was almost 5 yrs old & the battery was starting to go. After researching I decided on the XR as I use my phone primarily as a Phone & I am not a gamer. It was easy to transition to & the screen is larger but I am still able to carry it in my pockets. The $ was the most reasonable.
Iphone xr,Great phone. I had an iPhone 6s before and it was great but I really love this phone. I wanted to upgrade and I'm very happy that I waited for this phone. I can't get into all the technical stuff but the camera is great for the amount I use it and the battery is a huge upgrade from my 6s.
Iphone xr,"very intuitive. I have liked this phone so far. A lot of options, many I have not fully explored yet. I'm happy with the camera and especially like the screen size. The heavier device takes a bit of getting used to but well worth the trade off for amazing battery life."
Iphone xr,"XR is a great phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 7; the improvements are many. The processing speed and increase in screen size are most significant for me. Wireless charging is great too. 

Best Buyâ€™s experienced consultants were very helpful with the sale."
Iphone xr,Awesome new iPhone. The new iPhone XR was worth the wait! The phone is amazing and it's quite a bit better priced than the Xs or XsMax. Not everyone wants to make movies with their phones and this was the highlight of the new line of iphones. It was worth the wait.
Iphone xr,Great phone for the lower price! I have a XS Max for personal use and bought this XR for business use. Iâ€™m not finding much difference between the two considering the XR is less expensive. I think the XR is a great value if youâ€™re an Apple fan like me.
Iphone xr,"Wife loves it. I got this phone to upgrade my wife's 6S. So far she really likes it. The size is not too big, but it is bigger than the 6S. Face recognition works well. The camera is great. iOS works well and is really fast."
Iphone xr,"love the phone. I took the XR as an upgrade from my trusted 5s. It is a great upgrade. I love the facial recognition and the size. I was worried it would be bulky since I was used to the 5s, but I have enjoyed it."
Iphone xr,"Happy Wife. I upgraded my wife's iPhone SE to this larger to hold, XR. She is still getting used to not having the home button, but she admits that she does love having a larger screen."
Iphone xr,"Great iPhone! I just upgraded my iPhone 7 to the iPhone XR and I am pretty happy with it. My only complaint is that I didnâ€™t realize this model only had portrait mode for people, but thatâ€™s on me."
Iphone xr,"upgraded new iPhone XR RED. so happy i switch from Sprint to Verizon, good deal when i did it, I got a very special deal on the day when i purchased , buy 1 and get 1 free. Also free activation."
Iphone xr,Who needs an XS? Upgraded from a 6s. Larger screen makes a difference! Not missing my 6s nor wish I had gotten a XS which is a lot more!
Iphone xr,"Purchased for my sister. I bought this phone for myself and after speaking with the Best Buy representative, decided to buy one for my sister too. She is very pleased with the purchase."
Iphone xr,So far so good. I am 70 years old and upgraded from an iPhone 5. I was concerned that I would have trouble adjusting and figuring out a newer technology. So far so good.
iphone xr,"Love my IPhone XR. I walked into Best Buy with the intention of upgrading from a 6s Plus to the 8 Plus. So glad I went with this phone! It didnâ€™t cost much more than the 8 Plus and has so many features, which I am still learning. I didnâ€™t realize they came out the same day as I went into the store which was just several days ago. This phone is just more affordable than the XS or XS Max.
Itâ€™s different with no home button and swiping up to get my apps and such, but really it didnâ€™t take me long to get used to it. I just love the Face ID as well. I did use the Passcode at times on the 6s Plus, but it wasnâ€™t always convenient to do that. Now I just look at my phone, and I can keep Face ID on all the time. Love the color blue as well, and have it in a clear case to show it off. The battery lasts longer that my old phone too, which is a big plus. I havenâ€™t gotten into the portraits mode of the photos as yet. There is just so much to learn!"
iphone xr,"Great Phone with Some Small Issues.  My fiance is very happy with this phone, although for her it is a bit big and difficult to handle. This is not entirely due to the size but also the material being in her opinion rather slippery. This can be solved by a case, but that also adds additional heft to the phone. Although this is certainly a personal preference, comfort when using the device is important. 

For me, the screen is a bit compromised when compared to other phones at this level and the lower resolution is clear to me, but completely unrecognized by my fiance. If you are someone who doesn't easily notice differences in resolution, this may not matter to you at all. 

Overall the phone is fast and the cameras are excellent. In day to day use, my fiance is very happy with the iPhone XR.
"
iphone xr,"Solid phone without the Xs price. I moved from the iphone 6 to the XR because I did not want to pay the price of the Xs. Glad I did. The phone is easy to handle very responsive and the speed is great. I thought moving to this phone would be a big adjustment, size wise, but with the full screen Apple was able to make a bigger screen without increasing the phone size very much. Also, impressed with the camera
"
iphone xr,"Much better than I thought! Awesome phone! The bezel is barely different from the XS if you ask me. The screen resolution is awesome. That I truly believe you donâ€™t really see a difference compared to the oled plus itâ€™s plenty cheaper. Plus, thereâ€™s colors to choose from. This is like a neon salmon in real life. Great phone though! Speaker seams louder and battery lasts forever!
"
iphone xr,"Typical iPhone. I don't call it typical in a bad way. Typical in that it's exactly what you think the iPhone should be. I love that the screen is bigger than my 8+ but the phone is smaller. Don't miss the home button, but I do occasionally miss 3D touch. Not enough to consider knocking a star off obviously. Definitely worth the upgrade if you want some of the new tech."
iphone xr,"Good phone, but keeps turning on randomly. I clicked to review this phone and ended up incorrectly reviewing a video. Best Buy worked hard to help me with my phone, but Verizon screwed up everything on their end. The phone is good but screen sensitivity is annoying. Apple should never have omitted the fingerprint recognition on/off button like on the series 7 &8 phones, because I don't want to use facial recognition."
iphone xr,"So far, awesome. The iPhone XR is great so far. No complaints at all. The Best Buy team in Nampa is great. Weâ€™ve used them for years, and the experience has been great every time. There are a few crew members we remember over the years, but donâ€™t remember the names exactly. We just got the apple watches too, and they are too cool. Great products, sold by people who know their stuff...."
iphone xr,"My Mom Loves it. Got this phone for my mom, she was a an android user, but loves her new phone. Sheâ€™s able to use it with ease without asking me a million questions on how to do something. Screen is bigger than my Xs, but good for her as sheâ€™s able to see her screen much better. This phone is definitely user friendly."
iphone xr,"This is the most excellent phone I've owned... =). Apple, you have done it again... The new iPhone xR is simply perfection. I am in love with my new device and my entire spiritual health has increased... Seriously... Apple productsd will enhance the spirit of man, should man choose to make the correct choice... Thanks Best Buy and Apple!"
iphone xr,"Love it. Initially, I was lost without the home button. After watching the intro video, itâ€™s all self-explanatory and works SO well. I love the size. I can see more at once. Itâ€™s slightly heavier than my 6S, but so clear and intuitive. I love it!"
iphone xr,"The newest iPhone XR. I had My husband upgrade from his 7 s and he is always apprehensive about learning a new device the staff in the mobile dept are so helpful , patient and supportive. My husband is now loving his new device. What can I say apple has done it again!"
iphone xr,"Everything I need! I replaced an iPhone 7 Plus with the Xr. Although I gave up the zoom lens, the large, clear screen in a smaller frame and the speed of the phone more than make up for the loss of the lens. Yes, it's still expensive, but you get what you pay for"
iphone xr,iPhone XR. Took some getting used to with no home button but absolutely LOVE the face recognition feature! It's a bit heavier than I thought but an absolutely incredible phone! The best one yet of the iPhones!
iphone xr,Great Phone. Upgraded from my IPhone 7 and this was a welcome suprise! Great phone and exceptional battery life. I spend 8am-8pm some days at school and work and I get home with over half my battery.
iphone xr,"Best phone i have ever owned. Waited 5 years for this. Replaced my iphone 5, well worth the wait. Only thing that takes some getting use to is the larger size. Doesn't fit in pocket like the 5."
iphone xr,6 to XR. Made the jump from a 6 to XR. Easy to maintain workflow so I didnâ€™t have to re-learn too much. Photo quality is improved. Battery life is great. Vibrate settings were better on the 6.
iphone xr,Nice camera and battery life. XR pricing is a little better than some other new I-phones. BOGO deal is nice if adding a line. Camera and battery life is a plus with this phone. Good I-phone quality.
iphone xr,Love this phone. Love this phone! I had an iPhone 6 that was losing charge and was very annoying. You all had a special buy one get one free and it worked out great for me! Itâ€™s an awesome phone
iphone xr,Great phone. upgraded mom from iphone6s and she loves it as much as I love it. Our FaceTime is much clearer. Great budget iPhone for an older person that don't need those extras.
iphone xr,Pretty cool phone! The phone itself is pretty cool. I love how itâ€™s all screen! The camera is really close up though. And after you take a selfie the picture is really blotchy.
iphone xr,"Like being able to increase type size for easier r. Like some of the added features for navigating between different screens or apps. Would be nice to have an instruction book to figure out some of the new features.

"
iphone xr,"Good enough to get me to switch. Well made construction and super responsive, loaded with lots of features and I love the applepay app. Vivid colors to choose from"
