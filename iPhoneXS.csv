iPhone Model	Reviews
iPhone XS	"I got the iPhone XS and returned it 3 hrs. later. I'm a filmmaker by trade and thought this could be a breakthrough in filmmaking especially with a high-end 4k camera on board. I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40. Now I'll do a review on that as well but the IPhone XS doesn't even come close to the LGV40 in any shape or form."
iPhone XS	"Stolen item!!! Phone had been reported stolen by AT&T and stopped working. This seller obviously sells incompetent items.

iPhone XS	niiiiice. i love it
iPhone XS	"Seriously?Face ID is the worst part of this phone and it ruins the whole experience. There are so many times that fingerprint ID worked and Face ID doesn’t that the overall experience is just significantly less than the 8 was. The Wow of the larger screen/small bezels is short lived once you find out how many different odd ways you have to deal with not having a fingerprint reading Home button. At work I would get a notification on my 8, touch the home button and it was great. Now I get the notification and either have to pick the phone up or hit the screen until the passcode screen appears. With Touch ID I almost never had to enter the passcode and now I have to enter it all day long. If that weren’t annoying enough so many Landscape only apps have to have a white bar across the bottom of the screen to remind you that the only way Home is to swipe that edge. It just seems like they wanted to get rid of the Home button soooo badly that they were forced to make it work. Face ID does work—it’s as good as Windows Hello on my laptop—but it just can’t replace the Home button or Touch ID. It should be an addition to not replacement for. On the plus side—the screen looks great. Would have been great in an 8 with the new processor. Another “plus” is that my cracked back glass is not flaking apart. Gorilla Glass need gorilla glue. No I would not recommend this to a friend."
iPhone XS	"It's an iPhone. It's going to have amazing build quality, an amazing screen, Apple quality iOS, tons of features and a top quality camera. It's amazing! It is almost identical to the iPhone X of 2017, but there are a few very subtle differences. The main difference in this years model, the XS has the new A12 processor that does some insane processing that is basically what a desktop computer could do a few years back (and then some)... but this is in a phone. Pretty crazy!

These phones are also pretty expensive. If this phone wasn't going to be covered by my job, I wouldn't have gotten one. I'd rather spend my money on a full size laptop. But it is what it is. An Apple product. So... good job Apple.

iPhone XS	"I held on to my iPhone 6s as long as I could but the battery life was beginning to fade quickly so I finally decided to upgrade to the Xs. This phone is so fun and easy to use! I thought not having a home button would make it harder to control but everything is very smooth and easily accessible. The facial recognition is great and very smart, the camera is clear and takes great pictures, and the speaker has nice volume and great quality sound. The phone is also more durable than any other phone I’ve had and I finally feel comfortable using a light case with no screen protector instead of an otter box. I also love how long the battery lasts! I can use my phone all day long and still have about 30-40% at the end of the day.

iPhone XS	"I should have never left Apple for Samsung. After years of Android, the whole Note and S Pen thing really looses it's allure and is more of a novelty. I was quickly reminded how well Apple streamlines all the aspects of the phone, apps, contacts, settings, email, etc. I can go on. The battery life is great. I left the house at 4am yesterday, came back at 6pm, still had 36% left. The glass backing feels sturdy, and the processor is really fast, especially noticeable on my Arlo app, which lagged on my Note 8.

iPhone XS	"Great upgraded iPhone! Much impressed with the battery life. It far exceeds previous models and with multiple apps open, I can get through the day without charging.

Also little hesitant on scanning my face. Lol

iPhone XS	"I upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus, so this was a huge step up! I didn’t see the need to get the Max with the larger full screen on the Xs. Apple doesn’t disappoint!

iPhone XS	"I had the 8plus for a year and did not like the size of it. So, when I was able to upgrade to the XS, I did. It takes adjusting too, but overall, it has been great. I haven't had any issues.

iPhone XS	"I got this phone late Oct. and I've absolutely enjoyed everything about it. The camera is awesome and quality is great. Battery could be a little better, but other than that great phone.

iPhone XS	"now i get my huge screen without having a phone too big for my pockets or hands. though a pop socket is highly recommended the phone fits well in hand and is lightening fast, just waiting for 5g in the bay area

iPhone XS	"I previously had the 6S and was in need of an upgrade. Really liking this phone so far. The updated tech makes for a quick and smooth experience running and switching between apps. I’m also liking the FaceID. Would recommend!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"I skipped a couple of the newer iPhone versions as the upgrade just wasn’t enough to justify the price. This model is certainly quite expensive for a phone but I do like it. Beautiful display, nice camera, nice interface, no more home button.

iPhone XS	"The Apple XS iPhone was a change from the Apple iPhone 6X. After a few days I adapted to the phone without the home button. The apple phone is very easy to use and works great. I have the phone for about four weeks and I would recommend it to anyone.

iPhone XS	"Sleek, stylish, and fast! the camera is amazing and the screen immerses you into being lost with any app you use. social medias are refreshingly fun and games along with emails and txting have a new feel and are exciting. love the phone but get a case ASAP!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"Had the iphone x. The xs is a little faster, just enough to notice on everyday stuff. Other than that it's the same phone since I'm not much into photography, games or AR stuff. I suspect gamers etc. will see a bigger jump in performance with the new neural engine.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"So far so good. Still miss the button at bottom of iPhone and having the touch recognition entry but it’s not terribly difficult to get into phone. I keep taking accidental screenshots of my lock screen and activating Siri due to button placement on phone though.

iPhone XS	"I finally upgraded my iPhone 5s to a 10s. Wow! What a big difference. As expected, the iPhone is very user friendly. I love the camera. Portrait mode is awesome. With the spread sheet, power point, and word-like apps, I'm wondering why I still need a laptop.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"This is a great upgrade from my old iPhone. Love the battery length along with the screen. Still learning to get used to not having a home button but the Face ID is convient for unlocking various apps. Overall this is a great new phone and I’m enjoying learning all it can do.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"This is definitely the least exciting S release that Apple has made. Outside of some camera changes, there is really nothing better for the general user of the XS over the X. 

There's nothing wrong with the phone itself. Its a great piece of hardware. Its just not innovative.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"I traded up from an iPhone 8, very happy with this new equipment. Still learning the functions, but to date I have been totally amazed with the capabilities of this iPhone. I will consider upgrading again if and when there are any major changes to this product. Time will tell.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"This is by far the best iPhone that I've owned. It's facial recognition has exceeded my expectations and the phone is a lot quicker in responding and with loading apps. I really enjoy having the same size screen as the iPhone 7 +, in a smaller form factor.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"Had the Note 8. Had software issues and had it replaced 3 times. Decided it was time for a switch. So I went with the xs and love it. Have had it for about 3 weeks now. A smaller phone by far. Has great battery life. I get at least 18hrs and still have 10-15% left when I Go to charge it.

iPhone XS	"Purchase iPhone X’s, upgraded from iPhone 7. Adjusting to changes, I’m appreciative of speed and enhanced features. I do wish the price was less, however I’m entrenched in Apple eco-system. The reps assisting at BestBuy were very supportive and made the transaction so smooth. Very courteous!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"I upgraded from 7s so this phone has exceeded my expectations in terms of display resolution and camera quality. I have a car that allows wireless charging so this feature is very convenient for me. On the flip side, battery life is poor. I feel like I’m constantly charging he phone which I thought I would be doing less of. Overall great phone but you will have to bear more charging sessions.

iPhone XS	"Led screen is unreal! The screen goes all the way to the edge of the phone. Camera is awesome! Didn’t know if I would like it without the main button on the front. After about five minutes. Realized should of been this way the whole time. Only bad thing. I wouldn’t even say it’s a con. But the whole phone is glass! Very fragile! Feel like I’m holding a crystal egg! Get the Apple insurance and get a good case!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"Purchased the phone, and since it doesn't have the home key it is different to use. I really like the home key because it was easy to use. Trying to swipe the screen takes a little patience and practice. Once you get it, it works good. Picture quality is really awesome. Anytime you always upgrade to another phone there is something that is better, Otherwise happy with our purchase just wished it was not so expensive.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"The phone is great except that it either has slow or no connection. Apps constantly open to the no connection screen. I’m on Verizon and have never experienced this before. I’m putting my SIM card back in my pixel 2. I thought I was paying for 40 percent better connection speeds, instead this is by far the slowest connection on any phone I’ve used in years. Other than waiting a minute for websites to download, hello 2009, it’s a beautiful piece of tech.

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"I always loved Apple for its clean and slick looks. Upgrading from the iPhone 7 Plus to this phone was a great move for me. The specs overall are better and what really made me switch was the Dual SIM. Traveling a lot and now being able to use one phone and add in an EU sim will really make everything more convenient. I’m still getting used to the no home button and facial recognition, but overall I’m happy with the upgrade.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"My only regret would be that I did not get the XS Max (I couldn’t justify the extra $100). While the screen of the XS is bigger than that of a Plus, the screen is actually just longer and narrower, therefore when playing certain apps in landscape mode, the screen is even smaller than the Plus because there is a black border on the bottom of the screen to show the swipe up to home gesture. Other than that, the camera is great and the gestures make me not miss the home button at all.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"Previous phone was a 6S so loving that the XS is so much faster! The only thing I don’t like is face recognition. The thumbprint worked so much better. Face recognition is about 50% at best. I’ve deleted and added my face multiple times but nothing seems to improve its efficacy. I’ve had to change my passwords on bank and credit cards multiple times due to too many attempts to sign on - super frustrating!! I wish they would bring back the thumbprint !

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS	"I have used iPhone 5s and 6. This new Xs is simply amazing. I wanted a larger screen , but not a lager phone. This one is perfect. The entire front is screen, but it’s the same size as my 6. The new iOS 12 is an outstanding operating system as well. The new cameras on this phone are light years ahead of the competition. I love the convinience of Apple tech keeping my iPads and iMac computers up to date. I highly recommend this new phone. The price is well worth it.

iPhone XS	"I purchased the Apple iPhone XS for my daughter to replace her iPhone 5. She and her husband have invested themselves in Apple products. I personally do not like Apple because of thier proprietary systems and lack of interoperability with android or Microsoft products. I also believe that Apple charges way too much for their proprietary products. However, as far as the iPhone XS goes, it is a really nice smartphone, like most all Apple products are. My daughter likes her new iPhone XS and its interoperability with all of her and her husband's Apple products.

iPhone XS	Awesome camera! This product is perfect!
iPhone XS	"I went from an iPhone 6s to the new XS and wow what a difference. Went in store for the upgrade, everything went smooth. Had the phone 2 weeks and no complaints

iPhone XS	"I had a learning curve since I am use to a Samsung but so far I like it except for some of the apps are different or apple charges for what is free on androids

iPhone XS	"After using iPhone for more than 4 years.. I actually don't feel any difference , becaiuse I transferred everythimg from my old phone and it's the same UI. But the new features are there and the camera is good and it's so smooth to use.. battery is good too.. consistent 6+ screen on time hours for every 100%.. I love it.. though there are so many android phones with other features.. I find this long lasting and durable.. I would like to recommend this to a friend."
