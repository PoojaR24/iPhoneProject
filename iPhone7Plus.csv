iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Wonderful at The Moment
iPhone 7 Plus,Two Stars. The seal was broken before I got it
iPhone 7 Plus,"Not turly unlocked. it's sold as unlocked, but when delivered, I was surprised to find out that it wont work on Verizon or Tmobile networks"
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Fulfilled my expectations. 
iPhone 7 Plus,"I HAVE TO TOUCH THE HOME BUTTON W/BARE HANDS

This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone. No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves. None of them work with my phone. So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind. Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold! I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone.

SOLUTION

I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:

Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on.

This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot. Then to unlock your iPhone 7:

1. Press the sleep button on the right of the phone.
2. Press the Assistive Touch dot.
3. Touch the home button.
4. Enter your SIX digit pass code.

Okay, so now I feel better, but I still want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into ALL THE EXTRA STEPS each time you want to open the phone.

OTHER CONS

1. I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard. It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5. Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen. I have tried it on every sensitivity level.
2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works. Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over.

I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects."
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. I love it!! Totally worth it.
iPhone 7 Plus,"I can't use it, the phone only can use AT&T and T-mobile. My phone is Verizon. I am so mad at it"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Phone is great. It is brand new and sealed. Phone is great. It is brand new and sealed, but it does not have any great difference with IPhone 6s lol."
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good
iPhone 7 Plus,"I had a horrible experience with receiving this item on time. I had a horrible experience with receiving this item on time. Secondly, after it arrived, I noticed it was missing a needle like stuff that is supposed to be used to open the SIM card slot"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Who needs headphones? The sound of music was never better from a ""speaker phone."" I know conventional wisdom says start with the carrier and strike your bargain from there. But I knew it would have to be an iPhone, and my wife, moreover, insisted I accompany her to the Apple Store for my birthday gift--any Apple phone I chose.

I went in with every intention to to get an iPhone 6S, since the lack of a headphone jack strikes me as impractical if not preposterous. After auditioning 5-6 models, I left the store with the iPhone 7 Plus. The decision was simple--based primarily on one single criterion: the quality of the SOUND of MUSiC played back from the onboard speakers.

The sales clerk suggested I not dismiss the 7 too quickly on the basis of the headphone jack omission. First, the phone comes with an adapter that can be placed over your headphone pin and plugged into the charging port (that helps, especially given the collection of headphones I've acquired). More importantly, the iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone with: 1. stereo (2) speakers; 2. pretty good (for a phone) speakers.

The clerk then fired up a busy superhero movie score on the 4-5 iPhones I was considering. Not helpful. The clerk suggested pulling up any tune I wished through the store's Apple Music Subscription. I went with Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" which begins with Bill Evans rubato piano, then goes into tempo with Paul Chambers' acoustic bass (on ""So What"") in a call-response exchange between bass and ensemble.

Using the iPhone 6s, with a single speaker, the bass was all but absent (the store was quite noisy). Moving to the iPhone7 Plus, Chambers' bass walked right out of the phone speakers and into my ear, each pitch identifiable along with string ""buzz"" and extra-musical ""fingering"" noise. Suddenly the question of the headphone jack was rendered meaningless. The combination of stereo sound plus slightly more powerful, larger speakers was all I would need to get maximum value from the phone.

I'm a hobbyist musician (piano), and I no longer practice with a notated score. All I require is a player (and a piano) to learn a tune, and a device like the iPhone 7 Plus makes learning new tunes easier than ever.

I'm also a photographer of sorts, and the wider lens for unprecedented clarity shooting with available light as well as a feature permitting razor-sharp focus on a subject in the foreground and blurred-out focus on figures in the immediate background struck me as more than a novelty. With my 35mm film cameras (Pentax Spotmatics), I'd have to switch to an expensive, long and heavy zoom lens to achieve the same effect.

I've read that Apple may be planning on a blockbuster iPhone 8 with an OLED (curved) screen. I think I can leave the curves to Marilyn Monroe or a Cinerama production.. The 7Plus should last me and, though it's a tad big and cumbersome as a phone, it should be harder to misplace and/or lose than the previous half a dozen ""candy-bar phones"" were. (I don't need more than 1GB for using the phone, but 128GB is enough to carry a generous supply of music tracks and space for making videos).

Only problems: finding the best carrier for the least money and unloading three barely used cell phones (2 Jitterbugs and a Spark Aquos Crystal--good screen but artificially ""enhanced"" sound and barely accessible controls, if you can find them)."
iPhone 7 Plus,"It is the best iPhone you can get. As for the best smartphoneâ€¦ well thatâ€™s for you to decide.The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus at first glance donâ€™t look all too different from their predecessors. In fact they are physically identical except for: The home button on the front, the camera in the back, and of course the missing headphone jack at the bottom. The new iPhones are IP67 dust and water resistant so they can take a splash or accidental drops in the toilet which I won't demonstrate and will take Apples word for it!

Other than that, everything else is practically the same. The basic design scheme, layout of the buttons, and the screen sizes are still 4.7 and 5.5 inches. Anyone looking for a complete redesign, well maybe next year. Sure we get black and Jet Black colors but that's not as big a deal as apple made it to be on their key note.

I decided to go with the matte black, or just simply the black color because I like black phones, and the Jet Black looked like it could scratch and smudge way too easily.

There is a welcome change in the weight. This year's iPhones are slightly lighter than the previous generations and they house a higher capacity battery that will give you an extra hour on both devices.

Now the big differences from the 6S and 7 are almost all internal. The iPhone 7 and 7 plus new feature the new A10 chip which is of course much faster than its predecessor. There's also more RAM added, the 7 has 2GB and the Plus has 3GB. the smaller sized iPhone now comes equipped with OIS in the camera so that's no longer a unique Plus feature.

What makes the Plus unique however is the extra 55mm camera for 2X optical zoom and bokeh effects. Which we will get into later.

How well does the new home button work? Well it was weird at first. When I tried it out at the apple store when these were on display, I hated it. The force touch effect was nowhere near as real as the force touch on the MacBooks which feels like an actual click. However after a few days use, I got used to it and it.

As for the missing headphone jack, this omission obviously didnâ€™t make any sense and Appleâ€™s courage explanation still remains one of the greatest mysteries of life. There was no real benefit to the device in removing it and adds a minor inconvenience having to carry an extra dongle.

As it turns outâ€¦ it isnâ€™t so bad. My solution is to leave that dongle on your favorite pair of headphonesâ€¦ or if youâ€™ve already switched to bluetooth, then it doesnâ€™t really matter. However, times when you want to top of your battery while listening to your music especially in a flight, youâ€™â€™re either s*** out of luck or you need to invest in another adapter that supports both lightning and the headphone jack creating more first world problems!

Battery Life on the iPhone 7 Plus is on the above average side and you can pretty much get all day use out of this. I usually have my phone unplugged in the morning, use it for work, make calls, send emails, social media stuff, watch netflix while working out, and then by 9:30PM, I have 32% battery left.

As for the camera, just like every year it gets better every time. Now how much better is the question. As Phil Schiller mentioned in the iPhone Keynote, the smartphone or in this case the iPhone is the best and only camera most people will ever own. The 12 megapixel camera on the iPhone 7 Plus doesnâ€™t disappoint, it launches fast, focuses quickly and takes great photos.

On the Plus, you get that extra 55mm lens that gives you the 2X optical zoom as well as giving you the depth effect (or bokeh) after the recent 10.1 iOS update. Front facing camera has been upgraded from 5MP to 7MP so you can now take even better selfies.

Another nice addition to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the inclusion of stereo speakers. Itâ€™s a little weird how this is set up but it sort of makes sense. You have one speaker located at the earpiece, and another located at the usual spit at the bottom of the phone. They canâ€™t replace high quality stereo speakers but they sound decent enough.

Performance on the iPhone 7 is just incredible. It is faster than any smartphone out there, which is the trade off of Apple's tight grip on the software and navigating through the UI, launching apps, and running them is where the iPhone shines. Sure you get a few hiccups on some third party apps but they are almost always constantly updated.

I'd do a comparison with other phones but again, I turned in my fire hazard note 7 and am waiting for the google pixel. We will just have to wait and see how the pixel or 821 based devices compete against the iPhone.

But is it significantly faster than the iPhone 6S? In real world usage, you will probably have a hard time finding the difference. However, if you are coming from an iPhone 6 or older, then I would totally recommend the upgrade.

And to state the obvious, it is the best iPhone you can get. As for the best smartphoneâ€¦ well thatâ€™s for you to decide."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Love it and I am an actual user that is moving from the Galaxy S7 Edge. Not going to do a crazy long review. Just wanted to touch on some things. First off, the phone is just great (I am not focusing on some stupid cost of part BS someone else did, but rather actual use). I still have the S7 Edge but will be selling it. The battery life on the Edge was not that great to me and I tried everything to get it to be better. The iPhone 7 Plus battery life has been so much better. My S7 was usually at 62% when I got home for lunch where as my iPhone 7 Plus is at 87% (same usage..well maybe a little more for the iPhone 7 since it is still fairly new to me). This is roughly 6 hours of being off the charger and I use it at work a lot for pictures, slo-mo video of equipment and exchange email/texting.
The speed of the iPhone 7 Plus is also top notch. Considerably faster than my S7 Edge and also my friends iPhone 6 (not 6S). The camera or dual cameras work great as did the Galaxy S7 edge. I do like the 4K video better on the iPhone 7 though and the few low light shots I took were amazingly good.
So what about the headphone jack (or lack there of). This was something I was worried about at first. I have a very nice set of quad driver headphones that I use daily at the track. I wasn't about to invest in another set of headphones and give these up. When I found out they were including the adapter I said ""What the hell..I will give it a try"". The adapter is very flexible which is a good thing. The connection to the lightning port is solid and using it with my headphones was no issue at all. Actually I don't know this for a fact, but I questioned whether that port is supplying more power to them. Quad drivers need decent power (for the most part) to get sound volume and good quality. The S7 Edge sucked for this. The iPhone 7 Plus allowed me the highest volume yet and the audio quality at that high volume was right on. Again, I don't know if the phone is just pushing more power to them, but it is distinctly better.
I am not going to go on and on about this phone, but pretty much all other items. The new home button, pressure sensitive screen (although I know this isn't the first iPhone to have that), stereo speakers etc are just done extremely well.
The OS? Well I was a super moderator in an Android forum and know all the arguments both ways. I will say that the integration with all apps on iOS is just much more fluid. Sure, you do have some limitations, but when it works so well, why does that really matter?
I do have to ask some iPhone regulars. Has Apple made a lot of changes to their keyboard over the past couple of years? I just find the typing on this phone to be extremely accurate and it just feels right. As a matter of fact, I just went to take the proof picture and typed on the Edge for the first time since getting the iPhone. Not fun at all!!!

Call me a Apple Sheep or whatever you want, but I assure you I am not a die hard of any system. The iPhone 7 Plus combined with iOS 10 is just plain out superior to anything else out there!! IMHO

For the record I have the iPhone 7 Plus 128GB in Black (not jet black). I also have the Apple leather cover on it which works very well.

On a side note....iOS 10 messaging is a fricken blast!!! If you just installed iOS 10 and have not watched a Youtube video to learn all the new features you need to do it. And...if you own an older iPhone and you are not able to long press on the send arrow to get to more features, go to settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Make sure Reduce motion is set to OFF. Then you will be able to get to things like invisible ink, fireworks, etc.

Pictures are only to prove I own both. Not meant to show what anything looks like since they are low grade photos.

Enjoy"
iPhone 7 Plus,"The Incredible 7.Iâ€™ve been an iPhone user for years now and Iâ€™ve had the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6s. Currently, I am a user of the iPhone 7 plus. Now that I own an iPhone 7 plus and have adjusted to using it, I can speak on both the advantages and disadvantages that come with the phone. For instance, Apple decided to add a double camera which I think is a good enhancement because it helps to improve the quality of the pictures that I take. I often take pictures of myself, my friends and events that I am a part of. A good quality picture can help to preserve good memories. For example, taking pictures at Thanksgiving and Christmas with all the family around the table and the children playing. Looking back at the pictures from these events makes you feel like youâ€™re back in that very moment you took the picture. One of the features Apple decided to remove was having a jack for the headphones. Instead they replaced the headphone jack with another speaker. That is a upside to not having a plug for the headphones now, because now the phone is louder. However, I can not listen to music in my headphones and charge my phone at the same time which can sometimes be an inconvenience. In comparison to the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 has better and more advanced features. If you are a person who is constantly using their phone and likes to have all the newest techno devices, I would recommend this phone 100%. Overall I believe that the phone has made many well thought out decisions, regardless of the sacrifices that had to be made."
iPhone 7 Plus,Box with no phone. I purchased the phone as a gift and when my boyfriend opened the box the phone wasn't in there.I'm really disappointed because it was really expensive.
iPhone 7 Plus,"I love my iPhone 7 Plus. I love my iPhone 7 Plus. Here is a breakdown of my favs and not so favs, and I'm not gonna go into crazy details just major things from a buyer's perspective.

FAVS
Battery. This is one of the best things on this not so little device! I love it that I don't have to worry about charging it through the day. I leave it charging at night and I don't need to charge it again until I get home from work (and I have to say I still have battery left at night around 60 or 50% that's a lot!) and also keep in mind that the Plus has a bigger battery than the regular 7.

Design: The design is just beautiful. I got the Jet Black and I was worried it was going to be hard to maintained as I have read about the fingerprints, scratches, etc. But let me tell you is not bad at all and I do have OCD when it comes to my devices. Would I choose the same design again? Hell yeah it looks very cool and beautiful, if you are debating about the Jet Black or the regular Black go for the Jet.

Screen, quality and speed: Spectacular! I love the vivid colors perfect for playing games or watching movies! Speed is amazing once you lay your thumb on the home button it unlocks your phone in a second! very impressive.

Not my cup of tea:
Bezels: I really wish that they made the bezels smaller, it is a large phone so I wished they Apple would've thought better about making it more manageable. It is uncomfortable to have on your back pocket so you might have to get used to having it on your front pocket. Not a big deal for me but it might be a big turn off for others.

No headphone jack: I'm still trying to get used to this! My biggest disappointment is that I sometimes forget to bring my adapter with me when I'm traveling and I find myself having to listen to the radio because my phone no longer has a regular headphone jack. (I recently purchase the wireless beats and would be reviewing it shortly)

Random crashes: This might just be my iPhone but once in a while (maybe once or twice a month) my iPhone will freeze and it won't let me do anything for a few seconds. I will be bringing it to the store soon and I will be updating my review, hopefully is just mine.

Overall the screen, the battery, the design, iOS itself and the camera would make me buy this iPhone over again. From my personal opinion there are way more pros than cons for me to go with this beast!

I really hope this review helps you decide!"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Is it a substitute foe health insurance? No, but it could be a good prophylactic. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Congressman, was quoted this morning as follows: ""Buy health insurance, not a new iPhone!"" Strange, esp. from a Republican and under our new President, who's first priority is running the country like a prosperous business. If a choice is to be made, at least make it between health insurance and that Korean phone--hot an Apple iPhone! Actually, had planned on the iPhone 6S--the size and the headphone jack were both ""clinchers"" (I've got dozens of highly prized earphones). But then I went to the Apple Store and tried them all--6s and 7's (the latter at the salesman's insistence).

I saw nothing about the 7 to dissuade me from my original plan--that is, until the agent pointed lout a couple of details about the ""sound"" coming from the speakers ONLY on the 7Plus. Not only is it the only iPhone in stereo but the speakers are good enough to pump out sufficient bass to be a real practical use to a musician who listens and learns much music by ear (my reading days are go). I quickly dispensed with the demo tracks--superhero and cartoon features with orchestra arrangements and pizzazz. Tells me nothing.

But upon going to the most successful jazz album of all time--Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue""--I was able to verify the accuracy of the speakers at reproducing the most complex sound of all--the acoustic piano (the Steinway played by Bill Evans in the Columbia studio). More importantly, I could quickly identify the pitches of Paul Chambers' acoustic bass, which opens the first track: ""So What.""

That did it. A brainless decision--and a couple hundred more than I'd intended to spend. I hope its size will make it more difficult to lose. Also, I plan to make use of the ""portrait feature"" unique to this Apple phone (sharpens the person in the foreground while blurring out the background, for a shot free of distractions from the subject.

And of course it was good to know that headphones can be plugged into the power jack of the phone through the use of an adapter. But when I sit at the piano, I'd frankly rather dispense with putting the phone in and out of my ears. The onboard speakers are a big ""plus""--in fact, the deal maker, in my case. In short, this phone is more apt to keep me more healthy than another aircraft carrier."
iPhone 7 Plus,"his actually came with wired headphones. How cynical was that? I purchased this phone through AT&T to take advantage of several deals they were offering, and yes it does require me going out into my yard to shovel off the direct dish. Not that I actually would. My husband has fallen for that one before. (That deal is cousin to ""I will clean up after my puppy."") Currently not being in global warming has been very helpful on this February 60 degree day in Michigan.

I have always used an android phone, Notes 1, 2, 3, & 4, because of work and house networking issues. It always seemed like it was a good idea to keep one android phone in use.

The downside to having an android phone is that I ended up carrying three devices most of the time. Even with the size of a Note, I still had my tablet when I needed to be able to go online and work on different things. Then I carried my iTouch to listen to music and books. Of course, I could have put those on my android, but sound quality, through any Apple device, is better.

So I said to myself, ""Self, why are you carrying THREE devices around?"" We won't go into the entire conversation, but suffice it to say, I started looking for an iPhone. I did the research and I knew the problem.

The most serious, egregious, and unforgivable problem with this phone is that it can not be wired to headphones. No headphones attach. They have to be blue tooth.

For those of us who have invested a lot in headphones FOR sound quality, this is a disaster. It is ridiculous. Sure, I have bluetooth. FOR THE GYM. Where I can barely hear anything anyway.

And one way to tell Apple was out of control was that they included wired headphones. Where do they think I am going to put those?"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Five stars. I didn't purchase my 7 Plus through Amazon. With that being said if you choose to do so make sure it is SOLD BY AMAZON. Many reviews state it was opened or its a ""Korean"" model. You will possibly be tossing away $1,100 if you purchase outside of Amazon on their site.
The 7 Plus itself is faster with a better camera than my 6S Plus and I spent the extra $100 for the 256 GB model compared to the 128 GB. But if you have a 6S Plus and can wait for the iPhone 8, do it.
Additionally, there is a disclaimer from Apple on the Jet Black model only. It states the Jet Black color (only) is extremely susceptible to scratches due to the coating process used. I can verify it will scratch even when wiped with a micro fiber cloth. It's a beautiful color/shade but what good is it if it must be covered up to protect it?"
iPhone 7 Plus,"256GB iPhone 7 Plus in Rose Gold. The advantages are the dual camera that has a 12 megapixels with 7 megapixels for the second camera with DSLR quality, which enhances the colors and quality, has 2x the optical zoom and records 4k videos. It has the A10 fusion processor which enhances its performance and balances the battery consumption. The retina HD display with 3D touch that allows users to press the pressure sensitive display that allows you to access shortcuts faster. Water resistant of IP67, meaning up to 1 meter. The storage size of 32 GB, 128 GB, or 256GB.
The disadvantages are not having a headphone jack. You would have the use the lightning connector/adapter or buy wireless headphones. The price is outrageous.
Personally, my whole family is on team iPhone. The iPhone is great because I had a major upgrade (from the 5S). It is better than any previous iPhone models."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Mine is a Verizon one with same specs. No headphone jack big design flaw on great device. I got this phone after my iPhone 6 Plus can't touch disease. Very impressed with the iPhone 7 and I love the red. Part of the proceeds go to HIV support. One thing I'm quite surprised by his the very clear design flaw , there is no headphone jack . Where we are used to having a speaker on the bottom on one side and a headphone jack on the other side, Now there are two speakers. This means stereo speakers at the bottom and then only the lightning power port in the center. It comes with the same headphones you get with the six and five, only now they won't plug in normally to the bottom of your phone without a little lightening adapter which Apple supplies in the 7 box. The problem is you won't be able to charge your phone battery and listen with your headphones at the same time. You can only do one or the other. I don't know of this was their way of forcing you into buying a $75 cordless headphones but no matter what the intention, this was a mistake. And a great inconvenience for most of us . Has 1 million things and is such a phenomenal device otherwise."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Not worth it. Getting to saying goodbye. There are some very detailed excellent reviews of this phone already. I think the simple truth now is that Apple is not spending the time and money to be cutting edge anymore. Their price relies on the eco-system of iPad, Macbook, iPhone. The weakness in this scheme is that when these other components of the eco-system start failing (such as the Macbook Air quality/reliabilitycharging problems, then at some point it becomes less hassle to buy products at half (or much less than half) and replace them if they have problems. A Kindle Fire for 79 dollars is more easily replaced than a $750 iPad. Apple has become far too greedy. First they maximized what they take out of your pocket, now they go to the next phase of profit maximization, minimizing what they put into your pocket."
iPhone 7 Plus,"iPhone 7 Plus Jet Black 128gb. I have upgraded from an iPhone 6 plus to a iPhone 7 plus with hesitation. I was very happy with the 6 plus and was considering sticking it out for the iPhone 7S plus to be released. I mean, Apple introduced another phone that looked pretty much like the past two releases and I did not like that they took the ear jack out. However, the water resistance sold me. This was something that I felt would keep my phone safe when using outside in the elements. I also was very excited about the camera was getting rave reviews. So I counted the pennies and did the plunge. I opted on the Pre-Order with US Cellular picking the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb. As everyone knows, the Jet Black was a back order nightmare and I waited 4 weeks for it to arrival. I picked Jet Black though because it was a different look for Apple that I thought would appease my desire in change. I was warned up front about the coating being easily scratched so I had a case waiting for it when it arrived. Three days ago, it finally arrived! I immediately placed it in the case to keep the scuffs off the finish. But I have to confess that I have removed the case a few times just to admire the finish â€“ It is gorgeiPhone 7 Plus Jet Black 128gbous!!! The black finish has such an appeal to me that suggests elegance. Now letâ€™s talk nuts and bolts. The processor is zippy! I could see a difference from the get-go on the speed of opening apps and doing functions on the 7. I never considered the 6 plus a snail but in comparisonâ€¦.. Iâ€™d take the 7 any day! The camera is dynamic! I have found it so flexible to move from up close to far distant shots. Really nice far distant shots! The 6 plus had a decent camera but the zoom on the 7 is a whole new league. I really like the live picture feature on the camera as well. For those who have not experienced it, You snap a photo and it records a mini video of the second before the shot, second during the shot, and a second after the shot. So you can see the action leading up to the photo you had taken. This is done by pressing on the photo while viewing it. Its good for those viewing the photo to have another understanding what was going on when the photo was taken. Another improvement is the voice mail to text. Say you are in a meeting and a notification pops up that you have a voice mail. It would be disruptive to check the voice mail to hear the message left. With the 7, it prints the voice mail out under the play button. This is not merely a iPhone 7 improvement but can only be done on the 6, 6s and 7. Nice! So All in all, I am very happy with the iPhone 7 plus. I highly recommend the phone and canâ€™t wait to see what the 7s Plus has to offer.
"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Avoid! Doesn't work as a phone! Even after warranty replacement. The device is cool but it doesn't work as a phone. A warranty replacement did not resolve anything. I never experienced anything like this with my previous iPhones. I often have to answer calls up to 5 times before someone can hear me and the cell service drops out sporadically.

The Bluetooth is totally broken, cuts in and out with the hands-free in my car, defeating the point of hands-free. Bluetooth music connections are choppy and also disconnects every 10-30 minutes. Other people online complain about this same phenomenon.

I'm seriously considering selling it and buying a 6S but I wouldn't feel right selling a fundamentally flawed product to someone else. Again, replacing it with a new one at the Apple store from a newer production batch fixed none of these problems. I tried resetting everything and set up the replacement as a new phone just in case there was something wrong in my backup, but the problems persist."
iPhone 7 Plus,"The purpose of the IPhone is to have an easy and affective technology that is very easy to have. A. Introduction:
i. The product that I will be reviewing is IPhone 7 plus. My entire family have always been using the IPhone, we always upgrade every time there is a new phone that comes out. The first time that I got an IPhone was in my 9th grade and I would would not want to change to another phone company. The purpose of the IPhone is to have an easy and affective technology that is very easy to have accesses to.
B. The main strengths of the product are fast, strong, and affective
i. The IPhone has a lot of strength, one of my favorite things about the IPhone is how fast the phone it self is. Whenever I am out of the house without Wi-Fi, I always have internet on my phone.
ii. Another strength that I like about the phone is how strong it is. I had the same phone for almost a year now and it has been working very good so far. For example, that past phones that I had they would break or just not turn on but the IPhone worked with me really good.
iii. The IPhone is affective because it can almost do anything you want it to do. For example, whenever I canâ€™t use the phone with my hands I have Siri to do it for me.
C. The main weakness of the product is battery, headphones, and apps.
i. The IPhone battery is one of the weakness that I dislike because I use my phone for a variety of stuff and I can take 2 hours to drain all of my battery.
ii. Another weakness that I think the IPhone has is their headphones. For the IPhone 7 there isnâ€™t a charger cord and a headphones cord, so you cant do both at the same time.
iii. Some of Apps are not supported in the software that the apple company doesnâ€™t not allow.
D. Overall Evaluation
i. Overall this is the best phone I believe if you want a strong and fast phone."
iPhone 7 Plus,Great iphone 7plus. Like the color the camera is great all out it feel good in my hand it look just like a iPhone from the store has lot of gb so I can download apps
iPhone 7 Plus,"Best phone I have ever had! iPhone 7 Review
This past Christmas my parents bought me the new iPhone 7. Since the day I got the gift I have been in love with my new phone. The model that my parents got for me is matte black 16GB basically your standard new iPhone. I have had a handful of iPhones in the past and this one is by far the best one I have had and let me explain why.
The most important reason why I love this phone so much is just the fact that works and it works really fast. Out of all the iPhones I have had this one hands down has the fastest loading and processing speed. Along with the excellent speed of the phone it also is easy to operate making this phone capable of being used by just about every one. Another great aspect about the phone is I have yet to experience any bug problems or glitches with the phone. This is something that I am thrilled about since my last two iPhone sixâ€™s both had some bug issues so I am hopeful these problems have been worked out of the phone.
Not only has Apple make this faster and easier to operate then all the other phones they have made. They have also made it some handy improvements to the new phone. The first one that will make any customer happy is that the phone is now water resistant. This is a huge improvement because now you donâ€™t have to worry about anymore water damage. However, I would highly recommend using a phone case just to avoid the cracking of the screen from a dropping it. The second major improvement I use almost everyday is the camera. Apple clearly did some major work on the phoneâ€™s camera because you can now shoot 4K videos that produces just mind blowing videos with crystal clear quality. The last major improvement I have noticed from the six to the seven is the fingerprint scanner. This allows you enter your phone, download apps, and even pay for something just by putting your finger on the home button. The new fingerprint scanner on the seven is a lot faster at reading the fingerprint and more accurate. I personally remember on the six for it sometimes to take up to five times for the phone to read my finger before letting me in.
I believe the iPhone seven is a game changer in the phone world that can be used by just about everyone. They offer two different sizes of the phone two to fit everyone's needs. If you are not just an average phone user like me they offer different sizes of memory too."
iPhone 7 Plus,"One Star. Horrible internet speed...perfect in every other way but internet speed is too slow. I'd give it a 0 if possible, I'm going back to my iphone 4. This is the worst piece of crap crap has ever seen and crap has eyes......eyes next to the chicken. chicken"
iPhone 7 Plus,"I ordered this product and it was packaged horribly, when i opened the package. I ordered this product and it was packaged horribly, when i opened the package, the phone didn't even turn on. I tried to charge it but it just kept shutting on and off even though it was on 100%. The only good thing about my package was that it came with a charger bt the rest i give a 1/10. Im insanely disappointed. This was a waste of $850."
iPhone 7 Plus,"
2.0 out of 5 stars... it never broken a screen ever and take really good care of phone just a crap screen there where ... Apple made a phone to break this time I had it 2 days and screen broke and I took into apple and they want $130 to fix it never broken a screen ever and take really good care of phone just a crap screen there where 2 other people in there for screen replacement as well so beware"
iPhone 7 Plus,"The fastest phone money can buy. Switched from the Note 7 to the iPhone 7 plus and I'm so happy that I did. I'm loving using iOS and the camera is definitely better than my Note 7 was. The addition to iPhones of water and dust resistance are huge for me and the main reason I never tried an iPhone before, IP67 is almost a necessity for my lifestyle and my job. Also the build quality and design of this phone is just beautiful. It may not be bezelless like my Note was but it's a better looking and better feeling device. Button placement for the sleep/wake button could've been abit lower is my only complaint. Switching from Android to iOS is huge change and I like things from both. You can't beat the customizability of Android but iOS is faster and seemly more intuitive and well thought out. Also iOS is much ""cleaner"" looking and the keyboard and touch screen I find better. Jumping from 1440p to 1080p is literally not noticeable because the colors and sharpness of the iPhone 7 plus are much better. I actually prefer this screen over my notes and I really didn't expect that. I do miss the spen and the headphone jack but I've been wanting to switch to using Bluetooth headphones at home as well as work so now I'll buy a pair for use around the house. Overall the iPhone 7 plus is an amazing and beautiful device that surely isn't a huge change from its predecessors but a wonderful refinement. The addition of IP67 water and dust resistant and the major improvement of the camera to put it on par with if not THE best camera right now. Only the pixel xl and Note 7 are competing. The increase in performance with the A10 fusion chip also makes this by far the fastest device I've ever used, I have yet to experience any lag. If you want the FASTEST phone you can't get one faster than the large storage iPhone 7 and 7 plus. (Reports have shown that the 128gb and 256gb models are much faster than the 32gb models due to technicality of current storage manufacturing). I can't recommend the iPhone 7 plus more and that is coming from a top tier android device and using android for the past 4 years. Solid job here Apple, for me this is a perfect device."
iPhone 7 Plus,"I like this product would like to have a sample. I like this product would like to have a sample,Because christmas is coming up I would like to get on to give to grand kid, thank you."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Worst iPhone ever! iPhone 7 Plus is the worst iPhone ever!!! While the larger screen is nice. The health app is completely off. Apps tend to freeze and rebooting seldom helps. I don't notice any better battery life that they claim. I've been an iPhone owner since the first one, but this one is the worse one."
iPhone 7 Plus,Apple is awful. If I could give massive negative reviews on Apple products I would. They suck badly. User friendly went right out the window. iPhone 7s is the worst phone I have ever owned.
iPhone 7 Plus,"Five stars. It's exactly what's it's advertise as.

The phone was new unused, was able to put Apple care onto it. Shipped fast, and worked right of the box. Onkky con is it came with a European style plus not a big issue just something expect."
iPhone 7 Plus,One Star. $847 from Apple store(with tax)
iPhone 7 Plus,DO NOT BUY!! The phone lags and heats up for no reason.... I dont think the phone is smart enough to handle the fastest processor on the market! Sorry and it's waaayy too overpriced..... If I'm going g to pay this much I might as well purchase the Pixel Xl
iPhone 7 Plus,One Star. No go
iPhone 7 Plus,"LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!! I love this phone it looks GREAT but it also works very well. I did not by it on this account but I would get this phone instead of the 8 plus. This phone is like Cadillac of phones and the camera on the back makes it look so cool. I bought 3 to give for birthday presents and they loved them. My friend has a Samsung and my phone beat the camera"
iPhone 7 Plus,How 128gb help you. All perform screen the 128gb is great if you like take pictures or download a lot of games
iPhone 7 Plus,"not all phones here support GSM and CDMA. phone from Applehome only supports GSM brand. But article online says ""unlocked models support both CDMA and GSM bands"". This was not clear until purchase. Be careful."

iPhone 7 Plus,Great iPhone ! I've purchased this phone to help the seller sell these . You all should support the sellers product . This is a great product to consider buying !
iPhone 7 Plus,Love this phone. This is a great phone.
iPhone 7 Plus,"Improvements over the iPhone 6+!! The iPhone 7 Plus offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S Plus. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note.

- Better display (wider colour gamut)
- Better taptic engine
- 4 grams lighter
- IP67 Water and dust resistance
- Way better A10 Fusion CPU
- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p)
- Rear wide angle lens have OIS, telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS. Bummer!
- Better low light performance
- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE
- Slightly better battery life
- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)

The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S plus after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note.

The telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS which is disappointing. Images taken on the sensor usually underperforms, especially in low light conditions due to its smaller aperture size. Pictures taken on the telephoto lens is also usually slightly blurred.

People also reported on the hissing issues on the 7 Plus model specifically that can be captured when recording video/audio when the CPU/GPU is under load. Not all phones have this problem and for me, I just can hear a slight humming sound coming from the phone.

Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!"
iPhone 7 Plus,I want to try a sample. I will love a sample I want to try it out to let the world know how it works
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Best phone I have had
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars.Very good phone

iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good
iPhone 7 Plus,Four Stars. I loved this phone even though i didn't buy it
iPhone 7 Plus,"Disappointing. Slow. Worse reception than the 6. AT&T says the iPhone 7 can't handle multiple apps running at the same time or else it will switch to 4G instead of their LTE network. So compared to my iPhone 6, I have to now keep closing out all the other apps that may be running in order to get the one I'm using currently to work correctly. I haven't actually tried this....but we'll see. I'm leaning towards them not really knowing what they're talking about.

Apple claims the battery lasts much better. I'm not sure I can notice a difference between the 6 and the 7 in the longevity of the battery. I guess I can only say I'm happy it didn't get worse.

The processor seems slow. I was looking forward to these fast speeds that eliminating the headphone port was supposed to alllow. Again, I don't seem to notice any improvement over the 6. In fact I almost feel like my 6 is faster than the 7.

At the moment, I'm a little underwhelmed by my the new phone. It looks the same..but performs worse. I only upgraded because AT&T had a promotion that got me a free phone if I exchanged my 6 for it.

I got in a pool with my iPhone 6..hopefully the 7 will prevent me from killing my phone that way again."
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Nice fast speed heat proof.
iPhone 7 Plus,One Star. expensive
iPhone 7 Plus,"Five stars, happy customer. love this iPhone. I has Samsung galaxy phone and just upgraded to iphone 7 plus. Apple iphone is much better than the Samsung galaxy phones in terms of quality and design. I'm satisfied with my order and would definitely recommend iphone 7 plus.
"
iPhone 7 Plus,"The model information is false. In the order details ... The model information is false. In the order details it claims to be model A1778, but after having problems with the phone we took it to an Apple store and it is not the same model. This meant they couldn't work on the phone in any way because there was no proof it was legitimately purchased. Even after showing the Amazon order details this wasn't enough confirmation that the phone wasn't stolen because of the conflicting information, they couldn't tell us the actual model number for this reason. I have requested the correct model number information from PureMobile and am awaiting a response."
iPhone 7 Plus,"INTERNATIONAL VERSION NOT US VERSION. LISTING LIES. So, first and foremost, this listing title is a lie. This is NOT a US version unlocked iPhone 7 plus 256gb. It is an international version Iphone 7 plus 256gb. That means it cannot be used on any CDMA networks in the US such as Verizon or sprint. I know this because I tried to activated this phone on both these carriers. This phone can be activated on GSM networks such as AT&T or T-Mobile. But do not expect to be able to activate this phone in sprint, Verizon, or US cellular. I wasted 2 hours of my day going from store to store trying to activated this phone on sprint or Verizon. Furthermore, the shipping carrier left my $1000 iPhone in my open garage for everyone to see. When I got the text notification that my package was delivered, I went downstairs to check the mail. I opened the door to my garage and saw a group of individuals lurking around garage entrance where the shipping carrier left the package. When they saw me they ran straight to the street. Had I not been home to go get my package, these kids would have stolen by package left OUT IN THE OPEN by the shipping carrier. 0/10 experience from beginning to end. And amazon said they cannot give me an immediate refund even though the listing is a lie. Do not order from this vendor."
iPhone 7 Plus,I ordered my iPhone on a Tuesday and got it Thursday! It came in a sealed box with all the accessories & papers. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!
iPhone 7 Plus,"Problems with the Iphone. Need an answer IMMEDIATELY.I have a problem with the iPhone 7plus I purchased last month and which my brother received in Florida and brought me to Venezuela. It came without charge and, of course, I started to charge it last Sunday (when my brother gave me the phone) and when the battery was already full, I turned it off until today. To my surprise the battery was drained, no charge at all and the phone was turned off!!!! Please help me with this situation. I am really concerned about this issue. I live in Venezuela (South America) and have no idea what to do. Please answer me ASAP. Lucia"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Stunning phone! Stunning Black phone! Best product ever from Apple. Nothing much to say about the product, as reviews are available.

One thing I noticed different was the small pin to pull out the SIM card is not available with the package. So once you pull out the stunning phone and get impatient to begin to use, you have to run around to search for a paper clip to do the job of that missing clip!"
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Wonderful at The Moment
iPhone 7 Plus,Inferior. I ordered and did the update needed and it kept rebooting would not function! Sent back! And went to Best Buy and bought the more yes now I have payments but the one I purchased now works with the Apple warranty! Donâ€™t waste your time or money!
iPhone 7 Plus,"You work hard, just spoil yourself once in a while! Sold by Three Iron Collectibles. Holy cow what a deal! Purchased the phone at around $800 for and iPhone 7 plus 256gb (please note at the time of the review this was the latest iPhone out) the shipping was so fast, literally the next day and it came with so many extra accessories! I wasn't even expecting that. My boyfriend loves this phone and it runs so fast (why even have a computer?) so I bought myself a red one and now we have two."

Iphone 7 Plus,"That the iphone is having issues with multi touch. I didnt like that the screen wasn't from the apple company
"
Iphone 7 Plus,Great phone. Amazing thank you
Iphone 7 Plus,"starsTHIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED- FRAUDULENT ADVERTISING. If you can only use a phone with specific carriers, it is NOT UNLOCKED. This phone is NOT UNLOCKED. I could not put it on my Verizon service. The worker at the Verizon store explained to me that Apple made the 7 series specific to particular carriers, which must have upset many people, because the phones were changed back to unlockable with the 8 series.
What's maybe even more upsetting to me is that because at a glance this seller/item has an overall very high rating (which must be due to fake reviews), I didn't look at the reviews before I bought the phone. And apparently Amazon does't look at the reviews, either, because there have been so many reviews with complaints that are similar to mine, and also complaints of receiving fake iPhones (that did not seem to be an issue with mine) , yet Amazon continues to allow the sale of this item with apparently multiple, false representations. That is reprehensible, and illegal."
Iphone 7 Plus,Worth it! I am a genuinely satisfied customer. This phone is amazing itâ€™s like brand new! Came before expected shipping date! I got a better quality item then expected ( I bought the iPhone 7 Plus from wireless mall sales) I was expecting scratches all over the back but thereâ€™s only one scuff on the bumper of the phone that is easily covered up by a case. Everything works fine only issue is that it doesnâ€™t come with headphones but thatâ€™s fine because I paid a great price! Would recommend buying from wireless mall sales I donâ€™t know the quality of the other providers.
Iphone 7 Plus,"starsGreat price, great quality & great phone. I ordered this phone on Friday night and got a knock on my door Monday morning, my phone arrived (maybe because I live in Florida), but totally unexpected. Honestly I was skeptical because it said used & didnâ€™t believe I could find a 128GB silver for less than anyone is selling it for. Thanks so much Gizmo! So far no complaints and a great buy :)"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Excellent first time experience with refurbished products. This was my first experience buying a refurbished product. Initially I had a concern about the quality of the phone Iâ€™ll be getting, battery life, screen quality, â€¦. What I got was practically a new phone but without the original packaging, charger or headphones. The phone is in mint condition, excellent screen, no scratches whatsoever and looks like new. As an added bonus the phone came with a screen protector installed. Love it.
The 256gb is a breeze compared to my current 16gb. Like moving from a studio to a mansion :)"

Iphone 7 Plus,Phone review. The phone came with technical problems when I first got it the day I got it it was messed up. It wouldnâ€™t let me make FaceTime or regular calls and when it first cuts on it take 15 minutes or more for it to actually cut on. It took me over 2 weeks to figure out what the problem was. I had to get Apple employee in customer service to run a diagnostic on this phone and I thought it was something else but no they sent me a messed up phone. Maybe it wasnâ€™t their fault but yea thatâ€™s my review and Iâ€™m not pleased .

Iphone 7 Plus,"4.0 out of 5 starsnot compatible with verizon/sprint but itâ€™s UNLOCKED. i give this company that sold me the phone a very low four stars not because of the phone itself but the mere fact that the product description does not include that there is no compatibility with verizon/sprint companies even though its supposedly unlocked. this caused me to go through so much extra trouble to get my phone to have service. BUT i can say this iphone 7 plus was totally worth the money because it is impeccable. for a refurbished phone, the battery life is great, the speed and performance is top notch and there is 256GB of space; which is where the other four stars come in."

Iphone 7 Plus,"The new IPhone 7 Plus is great for any individual that enjoys using their phone regularly for the internet, texting, work, or taking pictures! We will go over the IPhone 7 Plusâ€™s camera, durability, storage, and sound features.

Camera
The IPhone 7 plus has a new double 12MP back camera with a 6 element lens. MP stand for â€œmegapixelâ€. This is the standard unit equivalent to one million pixels. Pixels are what cameras use to create photos, and bring the picture into focus; so the more the better! The double camera provides you with 25% brighter colors and in result, takes portrait- like photos. Additionally, the front camera is 7MP for taking great selfies. In past models the camera would get fuzzy over time or had what looked like blurs on the screen.

Durability
Apple Inc. showcases that the new IPhone is water, splash, and dust resistant. They state that the phone can withstand being submerged in up to 1 meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes, and suffer no damage. This is useful if an accident may occur around water, or even if you get caught in the rain.

Storage
The IPhone 7 Plus has more storage than ever! They now offer the choice between 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The 64 GB was previously the highest storage amount available. Anyone using their storage for pictures or work could use that space easily. On the new upgrade there are many more storage options, however the higher storage options are pricier.

Sound
The speakers now project twice as much sound, and have a great quality sound. On the previous model, the speaker was on the bottom edge of the phone, on one side of the charger jack. On the iPhone 7 Plus, there are speakers along the whole bottom edge of the phone, which almost doubles the sound from the last model. When you play music out loud, it sounds similar to laptop speakers! With this IPhone upgrade however, there is not a headphone jack located on the bottom anymore for music or phone calls, so an adapter or wireless headphones need to be used."
Iphone 7 Plus,Great condition. Phone in great shape as described!
Iphone 7 Plus,Lies!Lies! Bad mechant!! Lies in the tile. What I got is Japanese version not US version!! I am super angry with it!!! But I aready used it...
Iphone 7 Plus,"I have a gold 7 Plus with 128 GB. After having used Android phones since Android first came out, I decided that I wanted to see what an iPhone was like, just for a change. I had an LG V10, and while the phone itself was OK, I wasn't thrilled with the latest Android update, so that's another reason I switched. Also, I have an iMac and wanted to have a phone that could share the calendar, photos, and more.

I chose to get the 7 Plus rather than the 8 Plus because, after comparing the two, I just couldn't see paying more for something that isn't much different from the 7 Plus. I've had the phone for about a week now, and all I can say is, I wish I had switched to an iPhone much sooner. I really love this phone! I haven't used all the features that are available, and will update when I've discovered more.

Pros:
1. It's very user-friendly. I thought that I would have a big learning curve switching from Android, but I didn't. Maybe that's because I already had an Apple product, but even if I hadn't, I don't think it would be that difficult, especially since I didn't have much difficulty switching from a PC to a Mac.
2. The dual speakers are wonderful. I've had many different brands of phones, and the speakers on this one are finally loud enough to where I can have a phone conversation with them on, and hear perfectly.
3. It quickly paired with my LG Tone Infinim headphones, and my 2012 Buick LaCrosse.
4. It has a wonderful camera, and the pictures are much clearer and sharper than my V10, which had a pretty good camera.
5. Siri is definitely the best assistant out there, and I'm going to use her a lot.
6. I like the fact that one can still assign photos and specific ringtones to contacts.
7. It had no problem accepting Amazon Prime Video and Music.
8. The clock, if used as an alarm, is great. However, it has one quirk. If you want to use the snooze feature, you can't leave the phone on. You don't turn the phone completely off, but you do lock it with a quick click of the power button. I find that kind of strange, but that's how Apple decided to do it.
9. I have small hands, and it feels comfortable to hold. My V10 was a hair larger, so this phone seems a bit better comfort-wise.
10. Apple Support is awesome!

Cons:

1. I hate the home button. It's really irritating to have to press that thing instead of swiping left or right when I want to access something. In this respect, they're way behind Android. The only other phone I had with a home button was a Samsung S5, and I never liked it. I'm glad Apple has done away with it, and will probably trade mine in for an 8 Plus next year.
2. The battery is pretty awful. I don't use my phone all that much, and that thing drains pretty quickly. I can't imagine what it would do if I were a heavy user, complete with videos and games.
3. As another reviewer pointed out, the head phones that come with the phone are very uncomfortable, so I'll use either Bluetooth or use the adapter with some that I already have.

That's all I can think of for negatives. If I find any more, I'll add them in an update.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT WARRANTIES:

I already have an extended warranty on the phone via AT&T. However, I've been asking lots of questions about Apple Care, and may still get that. I was told by an Apple Support person that I should keep the Asurion one because Apple doesn't cover it if it's lost or stolen. I've only had one cell phone stolen, but there could be a next time, especially since a lot of thieves like the iPhone because it keeps its resale value longer.

However, with Apple Care, if I have a problem with my phone, they'll send me an immediate replacement, even before they get my old one. Of course, I have to give a credit card number just in case they don't get the old one back.

Bottom line, do some in-depth research regarding extra coverage for this phone. It's an expensive investment, and you don't want to get stuck having to pay full-price for another one if something goes wrong."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Iâ€™ve never written a one star review in my life, but this deserves it. Phone came fast and as described, but a week later it would constantly freeze or malfunction. Fast forward a month, I went to charge it (15%) and it never turned on after that. I took it to Apple and even they couldnâ€™t fix it or tell me what was wrong and they gave me a brand new iPhone. Save yourself the hassle and order directly from Apple as I do now; much cheaper also."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. all fantastic!
Iphone 7 Plus,Hey I would like to promo the phone. Cause I feel like I would bring more customers to the buy this product
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. love it
Iphone 7 Plus,"I ordered this product and it was packaged horribly, when i opened the package, the phone didn't even turn on. I tried to charge it but it just kept shutting on and off even though it was on 100%. The only good thing about my package was that it came with a charger bt the rest i give a 1/10. Im insanely disappointed. This was a waste of $850."
Iphone 7 Plus,100% satisfied. Exactly how i expected. Brand new!!
Iphone 7 Plus,"It surpassed my expectations. It came exactly how it was suppose too and I am having no problems with it.

Iphone 7 Plus,One Star. BTW the phone is now 600 dollars
Iphone 7 Plus,Three Stars. Is Ok
Iphone 7 Plus,Apple is awful. If I could give massive negative reviews on Apple products I would. They suck badly. User friendly went right out the window. iPhone 7s is the worst phone I have ever owned.
Iphone 7 Plus,LOVE. I got mine from buybackworld and it's not fake. I had att on it then boost and it automatically adapted
Iphone 7 Plus,Three Stars. IMEI of phone box hidden
Iphone 7 Plus,I received a fake iPhone 7 plus and it was missing the home button and when i called about the phone they told me to wait into 2 weeks.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Although phone is sold as unlocked, I tried to use this phone in Brazil and it's locked. When I called apple, they identified that it was locked by a USA carrier, but couldn't unlock. I am very frustrated, because this was for a friend and now I have to take the phone back to USA and return it."

Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. I loved the phone had no problems.

Iphone 7 Plus,Great phone. Bought this phone for my future wife.... she completely adores it... great purchase... you wont regret it.
Iphone 7 Plus,"I bought one of these to replace my iPhone 6 and was worried that it was too big but, so far, I love it. I have to use two hands to operate the phone but I find myself using it instead of my iPad Mini. There are times when I need a smaller phone (when I'm running) but I'll just carry the iPhone 6 for those times.
I like the screen, battery life, radios (WiFi strength is a lot better than my iPhone 6). The camera is a lot better but that doesn't matter much to me. So great phone if you don't want to spend your money on the 8, 8+ or X."

I really want to review this phone on YouTube on my channel Rayblen PB and show all of my reviewers.

And I will really appreciate if I get to review it on my channel and acually know how to feel to have one of the best phone in the whole world
"
Iphone 7 Plus,"The model information is false. In the order details it claims to be model A1778, but after having problems with the phone we took it to an Apple store and it is not the same model. This meant they couldn't work on the phone in any way because there was no proof it was legitimately purchased. Even after showing the Amazon order details this wasn't enough confirmation that the phone wasn't stolen because of the conflicting information, they couldn't tell us the actual model number for this reason. I have requested the correct model number information from PureMobile and am awaiting a response.

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. perfect phone!!. look like a new one
Iphone 7 Plus,"...Don't believe the hype. Where do I begin? First the good. The speakers are fantastic - stereo, bass, volume, clarity. Two bottom firing speakers and one coming from the earpiece. The best speakers I've heard on any mobile device.

Now the bad and the ugly. Scrolling, believe it or not. A simple flick barely moves a web page any distance. It's almost like friction slows it down. The keyboard, whilst great at prediction, is an absolute nightmare for numbers & punctuation. It easily ruins my flow. Third up is lack of confirmation when sending. Send an email and hope for the best. No ""message sent"" and sometimes it wasn't sent. Fourth, rearranging & sorting images. Ya can't. Folder management... isn't. Trying to save media from Safari? Well that's hit or miss. If you don't press the exact amount of pressure you might just get up pop-up option to save that you must use a second finger to save or you might get a sustaining link or the picture might just pop out.

Now onto music. All of my music is on memory card and Google Drive. In other words, Sayonara. Either that or I must upload my 3000 songs to iTunes. Wanna send music to your friend via email or WhatsApp? Impossible. Wanna extract music sent to you? Pull out your laptop and get iTunes.

Where's the intuitive part? More like a walled garden.

Touch ID. I'm coming from Huawei Ascend Mate 7. With one touch I awaken and unlock my device. With iPhone 7, you must press twice with differing degrees of pressure but be careful. If you press too quickly, that pop up message will disappear & you'll have to hunt for the message. That's because the pull down notifications aren't very informative.

*****The worst part is that I must enter my card for Apple Pay as well as ID. As I'm returning my phone, I deleted my card from one of them. Guess what, Apple literally won't allow me to delete my bank card from the other.****

Which brings me to the App Store. Some iPhone apps are more polished. Most have no ads so expect to pay for them. How much? Anybody's guess. Takes four clicks - get, install, buy, Touch ID. Far more convoluted than Android. Here's the best part, no price is listed. So I bought these apps & I'm never told how much I'm charged. I can't remove my bank info & my bank balance hasn't changed.

If Apple users think this is intuitive, it's simply because they've never used any other device.

On Android I can extract vids images and music from any browsers or messages. I can use apps to download free stuff. I can use browsers that allow me to name a file as I save it and save it where I choose. If I want to send someone a song, I can. With iPhone, I feel like a child on lock down.

Let's not get into the limited storage and lack of headset jack. I use Bluetooth too but when my battery is low, that's a problem & I refuse to carry a dongle.

Compared to Android flagships, it just looks cheap. Visible plastic antenna, a protruding camera that that makes the phone rock when flat, and those bezels - big forehead, big chin, love handles. Looks very dated

In many ways it just feels like a beginner's phone. A quality device to post you meals on instagram, browse Facebook and post on twitter. Takes a very good photo as well.

As it comes very well set up to sync with other Apple devices and it doesn't allow for outside music, if you're already invested in Apple's ecosystem you'll probably like 7 just fine. If not, you'll no longer have access to much of your stuff w/o a major headache.

So when you hear that iPhones are more intuitive and just work, that's simply not true. Clearly high end Androids have caught up and in many ways surpass iPhone just as they have in build quality. Saving media, Touch ID, commandeering bank info, keyboard, flexibility and especially compatibility are just horrible compared to my Huawei flagship. I can't even reorder apps so I'm constantly flipping between screens.

It's a well made but very basic phone with limited compatibility. iPhone users will be at home because it's the same app tray Apple has been serving up for years, with same dated icons. If you're accustomed to high end Androids and actually utilize what they have to offer, you'll feel as if you've downgraded.

This iPhone is a very basic device & it is no more intuitive than modern day Android flagships."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Not truly ""Unlocked"". I bought this iPhone unlocked but found out I was not able to use other SIM cards with it. Tried various SIM cards without success. Emailed Customer Service and was told it was my fault somehow."

Iphone 7 Plus,"INTERNATIONAL VERSION NOT US VERSION. LISTING LIES. So, first and foremost, this listing title is a lie. This is NOT a US version unlocked iPhone 7 plus 256gb. It is an international version Iphone 7 plus 256gb. That means it cannot be used on any CDMA networks in the US such as Verizon or sprint. I know this because I tried to activated this phone on both these carriers. This phone can be activated on GSM networks such as AT&T or T-Mobile. But do not expect to be able to activate this phone in sprint, Verizon, or US cellular. I wasted 2 hours of my day going from store to store trying to activated this phone on sprint or Verizon. Furthermore, the shipping carrier left my $1000 iPhone in my open garage for everyone to see. When I got the text notification that my package was delivered, I went downstairs to check the mail. I opened the door to my garage and saw a group of individuals lurking around garage entrance where the shipping carrier left the package. When they saw me they ran straight to the street. Had I not been home to go get my package, these kids would have stolen by package left OUT IN THE OPEN by the shipping carrier. 0/10 experience from beginning to end. And amazon said they cannot give me an immediate refund even though the listing is a lie. Do not order from this vendor."

Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. Awesome case, recommend."
Iphone 7 Plus,One Star. Expensive. 
Iphone 7 Plus,"This is a top class phone but expensive to buy. It is not a huge step up from the iPhone 6S Plus we owned but there are several good improvements. I have used this iPhone 7 Plus for many months to really judge how well it performs. It features high speed with a quad core CPU driven at 2.34 GHz. The AnTuTu benchmark was 178438 which is faster than my iPad Pro which I use as my laptop computer every day. For me that was an impressive benchmarking performance as I havenâ€™t touched my tablet computer in over a year since I got my iPad Pro. This phone just performs well and it is noticeable in browsing, syncing with iTunes and using apps. My iPhone 6 S Plus was benchmarked at 136477 so the iPhone 7 Plus is 31 % more powerful.

The iPhone 7 plus features dual stereo speakers with twice the volume of my iPhone 6 S Plus. It is a noticeable difference and I love it while playing music, watching videos or even making hands free phone calls.

One major change is that your new headphones that come with the phone uses the lightning connector and there is no stereo phone jack on the iPhone. The stereo quality is excellent and I like it. One downside is that you will not be able to use your headphones and charge your iPhone at the same time. That doesn't bother me as the battery capacity and performance on this iPhone is very good. At the end of the day I usually have 50 to 70% or more charge on the phone when I plug it in to charge it. My wife uses her phone continually during the day and she may have to recharge hers before the end of the day. The battery is 2900 mAh in capacity and it allows you to talk for up to 21 hours. That is about 1 hour longer battery life compared to my iPhone 6S Plus. That is also about 13 hours of use while on the internet.

If for some reason you want to use your old iPhone earbuds or your headphones then the unit does come with an adapter to convert the lightning connector to a standard stereo plug with a 3.5mm plug.

The camera on the iPhone 7 is exceptional. The phone actually has two rear facing cameras. One is for normal range photos and the other is for longer range photos. The latest update to the operating system allows you to take outstanding portrait style photos that uses both cameras to achieve a Bokeh effect. This is where the subject is clearly in focus and the background is not and this type of photo is normally done with expensive cameras with quality lenses.

The phone also features up to 2 times optical and 10 times digital zoom with 12 MP rear camera. We attend a lot of football games and the ability to zoom in is impressive and it produces a high quality photo. The camera also allows you to have an up to 6 times zoom on videos that you take. The photos and videos that I have taken are impressive and the optical stabilization helps you to take those long distance shots. The front camera is a 7 Mega pixel for those all important selfies. You can also take a panorama selfie for larger groups.

We ordered the large 256 GB memory capacity but 32, 128, 256 optional. The vast majority of people will not need that much memory.
The display is exceptional quality with 401 PPI resolution I love watching videos on the screen and using Hi-Res apps.

A powerful new feature in this phone is that it is rated IP67 Which is dust tight and water tight for up to 1 meter of submersion (39.37 inches) for 30 minutes. Since many phones are damaged by getting them wet this is a great feature to protect your expensive phone investment.

My only problem that I have had with the phone is that one day the screen went black and showed only a spinning dotted wheel. I could not do anything. I could not turn it off, reset it or use any feature. I found out that I had to press the power button and the volume down button simultaneously and the phone reset and immediately came on. I believe this problem was caused by me having the phone on and I inadvertently called myself and pressed several buttons at the same time. The phone went into the Twilight Zone. That was caused by my problem and not the phone.

Overall this is a great phone which a lot of power and with a great camera and features. I rate it at 5 stars."

Iphone 7 Plus,"Did not abide by conduction on time, demand was canceled by him. I would not advise him to deal"
Iphone 7 Plus,Great deal and fast shipping. iPhone is working perfectly in my country (UAE) no connectivity problems. The only problem with iPhone 7 is the hiss noise which is a general problem. Apple said it will replace your phone if you experience this problem.
Iphone 7 Plus,Iphone 7 plus. Ok

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. PERFECT
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good mobile Phone !
Iphone 7 Plus,Gotta have this. I finally have this infamous iPhone 7 Plus after waiting in vain in the middle of the night (around 2 a.m ) finally have my new phone.
Iphone 7 Plus,"One Star. No orginal box , badddd"
Iphone 7 Plus,Three Stars. ok.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Avoid! Doesn't work as a phone! Even after warranty replacement.  The device is cool but it doesn't work as a phone. A warranty replacement did not resolve anything. I never experienced anything like this with my previous iPhones. I often have to answer calls up to 5 times before someone can hear me and the cell service drops out sporadically.

The Bluetooth is totally broken, cuts in and out with the hands-free in my car, defeating the point of hands-free. Bluetooth music connections are choppy and also disconnects every 10-30 minutes. Other people online complain about this same phenomenon.

I'm seriously considering selling it and buying a 6S but I wouldn't feel right selling a fundamentally flawed product to someone else. Again, replacing it with a new one at the Apple store from a newer production batch fixed none of these problems. I tried resetting everything and set up the replacement as a new phone just in case there was something wrong in my backup, but the problems persist."
Iphone 7 Plus,"The phone is awesome! Great price, delivered quickly without hassle. As for the phone itself, it has a battery that lasts for several days (depending on usage), far superior to my now aging iPhone 5, and is super fast! The screen is big and beautiful and I love the 'feel' of the home button, which no longer depresses (presses in).

Highly recommended!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great device highly recommended
Iphone 7 Plus,"I know it didn't get a design rebuff, but the display is absolutely gorgeous, the thing is freaking fast, the camera is way better, and all complains I might have seemed to be software related, and Apple polishing 10.2 seems to fix quite a few.

I'm really happy with this product, and while I've been upgrading yearly for ages now, I was considering skipping this year, I'm glad I didn't."
Iphone 7 Plus,"I love my iPhone 7 Plus. Here is a breakdown of my favs and not so favs, and I'm not gonna go into crazy details just major things from a buyer's perspective.

FAVS
Battery. This is one of the best things on this not so little device! I love it that I don't have to worry about charging it through the day. I leave it charging at night and I don't need to charge it again until I get home from work (and I have to say I still have battery left at night around 60 or 50% that's a lot!) and also keep in mind that the Plus has a bigger battery than the regular 7.

Design: The design is just beautiful. I got the Jet Black and I was worried it was going to be hard to maintained as I have read about the fingerprints, scratches, etc. But let me tell you is not bad at all and I do have OCD when it comes to my devices. Would I choose the same design again? Hell yeah it looks very cool and beautiful, if you are debating about the Jet Black or the regular Black go for the Jet.

Screen, quality and speed: Spectacular! I love the vivid colors perfect for playing games or watching movies! Speed is amazing once you lay your thumb on the home button it unlocks your phone in a second! very impressive.

Not my cup of tea:
Bezels: I really wish that they made the bezels smaller, it is a large phone so I wished they Apple would've thought better about making it more manageable. It is uncomfortable to have on your back pocket so you might have to get used to having it on your front pocket. Not a big deal for me but it might be a big turn off for others.

No headphone jack: I'm still trying to get used to this! My biggest disappointment is that I sometimes forget to bring my adapter with me when I'm traveling and I find myself having to listen to the radio because my phone no longer has a regular headphone jack. (I recently purchase the wireless beats and would be reviewing it shortly)

Random crashes: This might just be my iPhone but once in a while (maybe once or twice a month) my iPhone will freeze and it won't let me do anything for a few seconds. I will be bringing it to the store soon and I will be updating my review, hopefully is just mine.

Overall the screen, the battery, the design, iOS itself and the camera would make me buy this iPhone over again. From my personal opinion there are way more pros than cons for me to go with this beast!

I really hope this review helps you decide!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Very good
Iphone 7 Plus,"I didn't purchase my 7 Plus through Amazon. With that being said if you choose to do so make sure it is SOLD BY AMAZON. Many reviews state it was opened or its a ""Korean"" model. You will possibly be tossing away $1,100 if you purchase outside of Amazon on their site.
The 7 Plus itself is faster with a better camera than my 6S Plus and I spent the extra $100 for the 256 GB model compared to the 128 GB. But if you have a 6S Plus and can wait for the iPhone 8, do it.
Additionally, there is a disclaimer from Apple on the Jet Black model only. It states the Jet Black color (only) is extremely susceptible to scratches due to the coating process used. I can verify it will scratch even when wiped with a micro fiber cloth. It's a beautiful color/shade but what good is it if it must be covered up to protect it?"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. An Awesome phone
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. espectacular
Iphone 7 Plus,"Delivered ahead of time, no issues. Good job. Thank you so much."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Apple made a phone to break this time I had it 2 days and screen broke and I took into apple and they want $130 to fix it never broken a screen ever and take really good care of phone just a crap screen there where 2 other people in there for screen replacement as well so beware
"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. It is great !!!
Iphone 7 Plus,Four Stars. This phone is awesome. It met all expectation. Defintely a recommendation to purchase. The price however is too high.
Iphone 7 Plus,Product was fair- good range. It was not Like-New condition. There were lots of screen scratches as well as the cuffs of the iphone has been compromised. Product was fair- good range.
Iphone 7 Plus,Excellent. I really like this! it's a dream come true!
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Very nice
Iphone 7 Plus,"Don't bother. I have been a fervent Samsung fan since the S4 but I finally got fed up with the appalling battery life on the S6 that I still have. As with all expensive phones I am careful - screen protector and case go on at the same time the phone comes out of the box. I made the jump to Apple because my family all have them and I travel abroad so much - making it easier to communicate within the iMessage environment.

I have been using WhatsApp for years and thought the transition of transferring my messages from the backup would be easy. NO WAY. The only way to do it is to pay for third party software to get all your old messages transferred across. No big deal - just another $20.

Then when the phone falls on the floor flat from a coffee table (about a foot tall) I paid no attention at the time. Later in the day I see that the screen is cracked! Seriously? After 2 weeks! I have dropped many of the Samsung phones over the years from higher places and awkward angles and the worst I have had is to change the screen protector. But nope this is a goner already. What happened to Cornings glass and all that good stuff? Have I bought a fake phone or is the build quality really that poor? For over $1000 I expect more but sadly I am not in the US at the moment. I am disgusted and obviously regret this purchase.

**Update** Sadly the story gets worse. The crack has turned out to be water damage so even with insurance that is now another $100 to replace the phone! Water resistant does not mean water proof - well I know that but it is supposed to resist being wet in my pocket during a rain shower, right? Well apparently not. So honestly after watching videos of people sticking this phone into 1.5m of water for 30 minutes I am even more dumbfounded. Why bother labelling it water resistant at all - just keep the damn phone dry like before. One day they will have a waterproof phone - oh yes they already exist but not at Apple."
Iphone 7 Plus,FINE SMARTPHONE BUT APPLE NEEDS A NEW SETVE JOBS TO RE-LAUNCH SOME OUTSTANDING IDEAS AGAIN
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Best phone I have had
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. all good.

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. I like.
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. A work of art for a machine
Iphone 7 Plus,More of the same and for a very high price...
Iphone 7 Plus,"Not worth it. Getting to saying goodbye. There are some very detailed excellent reviews of this phone already. I think the simple truth now is that Apple is not spending the time and money to be cutting edge anymore. Their price relies on the eco-system of iPad, Macbook, iPhone. The weakness in this scheme is that when these other components of the eco-system start failing (such as the Macbook Air quality/reliabilitycharging problems, then at some point it becomes less hassle to buy products at half (or much less than half) and replace them if they have problems. A Kindle Fire for 79 dollars is more easily replaced than a $750 iPad. Apple has become far too greedy. First they maximized what they take out of your pocket, now they go to the next phase of profit maximization, minimizing what they put into your pocket."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. great product, great price"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. Great service, they call and verifies what phone I wanted. Would definitely recommend it again!"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Fast delivery. iPhone arrive at the time completely new , but box was open , I mean It came with an plastic cover like the new one from apple but it was obviously open previously because inside the phone there was a SIM card , I was not surprised because I read that before in the other comments , yesterday my phone was inhibited for minutes , ive read thats normal un iPhone 7 plus , so Im happy for the Fast delivery but kinda worry for the product"

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Perfect!
Iphone 7 Plus,"Review from an iPhone 7 plus owner. The phone its self is great, but it has some improvement that need to be made such as the dongle they give you to use 3.5mm jack headphones constantly makes buzzing sounds. The phone also has some weird little bugs in the software such as one time I couldn't adjust the brightness so I had to power the phone off and then on and then it was fixed, another time the phone was stuck in landscape view and I had to power cycle it to get back to portrait view."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. It's was good , thank you"
Iphone 7 Plus,DO NOT BUY!! The phone lags and heats up for no reason.... I dont think the phone is smart enough to handle the fastest processor on the market! Sorry and it's waaayy too overpriced..... If I'm going g to pay this much I might as well purchase the Pixel Xl
Iphone 7 Plus,Excellent
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. good.
Iphone 7 Plus,"I bought this phone hoping it was unlocked because I rather like my boost service, and long behold it wasn't unlocked this phone only works with either T-Mobile or Verizon nothing else. But I did end up changing my plan to T-Mobile I'm paying the same amount with not that great of service but I guess boost doesn't work with the 7 plus yet so ill have to wait. but my phone was not opened or anything like that. other then the service s*** I'm very pleased with my phone"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Super item
Iphone 7 Plus,"I had a horrible experience with receiving this item on time. Secondly, after it arrived, I noticed it was missing a needle like stuff that is supposed to be used to open the SIM card slot"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Just perfect!
Iphone 7 Plus,One Star. Bad.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. No problems, very satisfied"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Extremely poor quality of Jet Black Finish.

I loved it when I took it out of the box. And immediately applied Ringke Fusion Silicon Case on it at back and Zagg screen protector at the front.

However after 7 days when I removed the silicon case, I found several small abrasion dots which are permanent and I couldn't remove them by all means. The disappointing thing is that I never used it without a case then how those dots appeared only in a week and that the quality of Jet black finish is that much low that the dots appeared even in the presence of silicon case produced by well known company...

Never get a Jet black color"
Iphone 7 Plus,Love it. Mine is in the Rose Gold and a 256. I didn't order from Amazon I purchased directly from Apple. It shipped directly to me from China ahead of the scheduled date and I've been using it for over 2 months now. Days after it arrived I took it with me to Disney in Ca. My pictures came out amazing. I replaced the 6plus s which I liked but the 7 seems a little lighter and my battery does last longer. It's supper fast. At first I hated that I didn't get BT ear buds (I thought it would come with the phone) instead I got the old wired ones with a dongle to attach. I was concerned my phone would die while using the earbuds and I would have a situation of having to choose between charging and listening. Hasn't happened yet. The 7plus had good batter life and that says a lot being I'm a person who always needs my desktop on bright. Overall I'm very pleased.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Excellent and fast shipping.

The only concerns is headphones not coming without original ones.

I was waiting for AIRPODS phones"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Excelente servicio

Other than that battery is good,speakers great.Great GSM quality if you are international.
Good phone,order and enjoy :)

Thanks and I hope so this will help you decide to pick right one )"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. FAST SHIPPING. A+++
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Excelente.
Iphone 7 Plus,"The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus at first glance donâ€™t look all too different from their predecessors. In fact they are physically identical except for: The home button on the front, the camera in the back, and of course the missing headphone jack at the bottom. The new iPhones are IP67 dust and water resistant so they can take a splash or accidental drops in the toilet which I won't demonstrate and will take Apples word for it!

Other than that, everything else is practically the same. The basic design scheme, layout of the buttons, and the screen sizes are still 4.7 and 5.5 inches. Anyone looking for a complete redesign, well maybe next year. Sure we get black and Jet Black colors but that's not as big a deal as apple made it to be on their key note.

I decided to go with the matte black, or just simply the black color because I like black phones, and the Jet Black looked like it could scratch and smudge way too easily.

There is a welcome change in the weight. This year's iPhones are slightly lighter than the previous generations and they house a higher capacity battery that will give you an extra hour on both devices.

Now the big differences from the 6S and 7 are almost all internal. The iPhone 7 and 7 plus new feature the new A10 chip which is of course much faster than its predecessor. There's also more RAM added, the 7 has 2GB and the Plus has 3GB. the smaller sized iPhone now comes equipped with OIS in the camera so that's no longer a unique Plus feature.

What makes the Plus unique however is the extra 55mm camera for 2X optical zoom and bokeh effects. Which we will get into later.

How well does the new home button work? Well it was weird at first. When I tried it out at the apple store when these were on display, I hated it. The force touch effect was nowhere near as real as the force touch on the MacBooks which feels like an actual click. However after a few days use, I got used to it and it.

As for the missing headphone jack, this omission obviously didnâ€™t make any sense and Appleâ€™s courage explanation still remains one of the greatest mysteries of life. There was no real benefit to the device in removing it and adds a minor inconvenience having to carry an extra dongle.

As it turns outâ€¦ it isnâ€™t so bad. My solution is to leave that dongle on your favorite pair of headphonesâ€¦ or if youâ€™ve already switched to bluetooth, then it doesnâ€™t really matter. However, times when you want to top of your battery while listening to your music especially in a flight, youâ€™â€™re either s*** out of luck or you need to invest in another adapter that supports both lightning and the headphone jack creating more first world problems!

Battery Life on the iPhone 7 Plus is on the above average side and you can pretty much get all day use out of this. I usually have my phone unplugged in the morning, use it for work, make calls, send emails, social media stuff, watch netflix while working out, and then by 9:30PM, I have 32% battery left.

As for the camera, just like every year it gets better every time. Now how much better is the question. As Phil Schiller mentioned in the iPhone Keynote, the smartphone or in this case the iPhone is the best and only camera most people will ever own. The 12 megapixel camera on the iPhone 7 Plus doesnâ€™t disappoint, it launches fast, focuses quickly and takes great photos.

On the Plus, you get that extra 55mm lens that gives you the 2X optical zoom as well as giving you the depth effect (or bokeh) after the recent 10.1 iOS update. Front facing camera has been upgraded from 5MP to 7MP so you can now take even better selfies.

Another nice addition to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the inclusion of stereo speakers. Itâ€™s a little weird how this is set up but it sort of makes sense. You have one speaker located at the earpiece, and another located at the usual spit at the bottom of the phone. They canâ€™t replace high quality stereo speakers but they sound decent enough.

Performance on the iPhone 7 is just incredible. It is faster than any smartphone out there, which is the trade off of Apple's tight grip on the software and navigating through the UI, launching apps, and running them is where the iPhone shines. Sure you get a few hiccups on some third party apps but they are almost always constantly updated.

I'd do a comparison with other phones but again, I turned in my fire hazard note 7 and am waiting for the google pixel. We will just have to wait and see how the pixel or 821 based devices compete against the iPhone.

But is it significantly faster than the iPhone 6S? In real world usage, you will probably have a hard time finding the difference. However, if you are coming from an iPhone 6 or older, then I would totally recommend the upgrade.

And to state the obvious, it is the best iPhone you can get. As for the best smartphoneâ€¦ well thatâ€™s for you to decide."
Iphone 7 Plus,"One Star. I have many problems, the phone did not come unlocked and I'm in Venezuela"
Iphone 7 Plus,No thanks. I'm not ordering it.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. Just as I expected, all info transferred automatically. This company charged me too much, i found a 256gb for $100.00 less"

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Perfect! Everything was as expected!
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great new IPhone Im happy
Iphone 7 Plus,"The best iPhone ever. The iPhone 7 (Plus) is by far the best iPhone ever created, possibly the best phone ever created. However, because it is similar to previous iPhones, I will try to focus on whats new and whats so great about it. First the processor, its amazing, but so is the processor in just about every phone now a days. But considering this phone is more powerful then any MacBook or MacBook Air, or Even iPad ever created, its pretty remarkable.

Second, and this is probably the biggest, and greatest thing about this phone, is the camera, or should I say cameras. The iPhone 7 (Plus) hands down features the best camera on a phone I have ever seen. It is really fast to focus and to fire, and images are sharp and extremely color accurate. In fact, after putting this camera through its paces, I questioned why I even owned my Canon EOS 5D Mark III. But then I remembered, BOKEH. IOS 10.1 (which I beta tested) bring ""Portrait Mode"" which works, however not always. Also its not as good as a fast lens on my full-frame body, but there is definitely room to improve the portrait mode blurred effect. Overall this is a great camera.

One of the last great things about this phone is the display. When I first placed my order, I wondered if the display would live up to the claims. Wider-color gamut, 25% brighter. Well it definitely does. This is honestly one of the most color accurate displays I have ever seen, and boy does it get bright when it needs to.

Finally the added 256GB storage option is much appreciated, as I am a storage hog. Also I absolutely love the Jet Black color. this reminds of my first iPhone, the iPhone 3G. There are some negatives to this phone however, it definitely ""Hisses"" for one. However unless my phone is to the Apple Logo on the phone, I can not hear it. Also, the display is slightly (very slightly) more yellow then the iPhone 6s. However after using, I pulled out my iPhone 6s Plus, and though my iPhone 6s plus display was actually more yellow.

If the small hiccups bother you, return it and get a new one, or go to the genus bar for a replacement. Other wise, sit back, and enjoy the best phone ever created.

I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus 256GB Jet Black T-Mobile through Apples website at launch."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. I relay in love with this one
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. good. i bought this phone and its working good
but i dont know i got a Verizon sim inside the phone . my phone is unlocked ."
Iphone 7 Plus,"The fastest phone money can buy. Switched from the Note 7 to the iPhone 7 plus and I'm so happy that I did. I'm loving using iOS and the camera is definitely better than my Note 7 was. The addition to iPhones of water and dust resistance are huge for me and the main reason I never tried an iPhone before, IP67 is almost a necessity for my lifestyle and my job. Also the build quality and design of this phone is just beautiful. It may not be bezelless like my Note was but it's a better looking and better feeling device. Button placement for the sleep/wake button could've been abit lower is my only complaint. Switching from Android to iOS is huge change and I like things from both. You can't beat the customizability of Android but iOS is faster and seemly more intuitive and well thought out. Also iOS is much ""cleaner"" looking and the keyboard and touch screen I find better. Jumping from 1440p to 1080p is literally not noticeable because the colors and sharpness of the iPhone 7 plus are much better. I actually prefer this screen over my notes and I really didn't expect that. I do miss the spen and the headphone jack but I've been wanting to switch to using Bluetooth headphones at home as well as work so now I'll buy a pair for use around the house. Overall the iPhone 7 plus is an amazing and beautiful device that surely isn't a huge change from its predecessors but a wonderful refinement. The addition of IP67 water and dust resistant and the major improvement of the camera to put it on par with if not THE best camera right now. Only the pixel xl and Note 7 are competing. The increase in performance with the A10 fusion chip also makes this by far the fastest device I've ever used, I have yet to experience any lag. If you want the FASTEST phone you can't get one faster than the large storage iPhone 7 and 7 plus. (Reports have shown that the 128gb and 256gb models are much faster than the 32gb models due to technicality of current storage manufacturing). I can't recommend the iPhone 7 plus more and that is coming from a top tier android device and using android for the past 4 years. Solid job here Apple, for me this is a perfect device."
Iphone 7 Plus,"I can't use it, the phone only can use AT&T and T-mobile. My phone is Verizon. I am so mad at it"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Stunning Black phone! Best product ever from Apple. Nothing much to say about the product, as reviews are available.

One thing I noticed different was the small pin to pull out the SIM card is not available with the package. So once you pull out the stunning phone and get impatient to begin to use, you have to run around to search for a paper clip to do the job of that missing clip!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Awesome phone delivered before time
Iphone 7 Plus,"iPhone 7 pPlus Jet Black 128gb. I have upgraded from an iPhone 6 plus to a iPhone 7 plus with hesitation. I was very happy with the 6 plus and was considering sticking it out for the iPhone 7S plus to be released. I mean, Apple introduced another phone that looked pretty much like the past two releases and I did not like that they took the ear jack out. However, the water resistance sold me. This was something that I felt would keep my phone safe when using outside in the elements. I also was very excited about the camera was getting rave reviews. So I counted the pennies and did the plunge. I opted on the Pre-Order with US Cellular picking the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb. As everyone knows, the Jet Black was a back order nightmare and I waited 4 weeks for it to arrival. I picked Jet Black though because it was a different look for Apple that I thought would appease my desire in change. I was warned up front about the coating being easily scratched so I had a case waiting for it when it arrived. Three days ago, it finally arrived! I immediately placed it in the case to keep the scuffs off the finish. But I have to confess that I have removed the case a few times just to admire the finish â€“ It is gorgeiPhone 7 Plus Jet Black 128gbous!!! The black finish has such an appeal to me that suggests elegance. Now letâ€™s talk nuts and bolts. The processor is zippy! I could see a difference from the get-go on the speed of opening apps and doing functions on the 7. I never considered the 6 plus a snail but in comparisonâ€¦.. Iâ€™d take the 7 any day! The camera is dynamic! I have found it so flexible to move from up close to far distant shots. Really nice far distant shots! The 6 plus had a decent camera but the zoom on the 7 is a whole new league. I really like the live picture feature on the camera as well. For those who have not experienced it, You snap a photo and it records a mini video of the second before the shot, second during the shot, and a second after the shot. So you can see the action leading up to the photo you had taken. This is done by pressing on the photo while viewing it. Its good for those viewing the photo to have another understanding what was going on when the photo was taken. Another improvement is the voice mail to text. Say you are in a meeting and a notification pops up that you have a voice mail. It would be disruptive to check the voice mail to hear the message left. With the 7, it prints the voice mail out under the play button. This is not merely a iPhone 7 improvement but can only be done on the 6, 6s and 7. Nice! So All in all, I am very happy with the iPhone 7 plus. I highly recommend the phone and canâ€™t wait to see what the 7s Plus has to offer."
Iphone 7 Plus,"256GB iPhone 7 Plus in Rose Gold. The advantages are the dual camera that has a 12 megapixels with 7 megapixels for the second camera with DSLR quality, which enhances the colors and quality, has 2x the optical zoom and records 4k videos. It has the A10 fusion processor which enhances its performance and balances the battery consumption. The retina HD display with 3D touch that allows users to press the pressure sensitive display that allows you to access shortcuts faster. Water resistant of IP67, meaning up to 1 meter. The storage size of 32 GB, 128 GB, or 256GB.
The disadvantages are not having a headphone jack. You would have the use the lightning connector/adapter or buy wireless headphones. The price is outrageous.
Personally, my whole family is on team iPhone. The iPhone is great because I had a major upgrade (from the 5S). It is better than any previous iPhone models."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good
Iphone 7 Plus,"Not sealed and Factory unlocked. it's a Verizon phone. Just be aware before you think about to buy it. It's not Brand New or sealed and nor a factory unlocked phone. I found a verizon sim card inside the phone and it doesn't support t-mobile, lyca mobile, and altra mobile. I was excited about this new phone but it's just destroyed my excitement in a minute.I never expected anything like that from Amazon."
Iphone 7 Plus,"not all phones here support GSM and CDMA. phone from Applehome only supports GSM brand. But article online says ""unlocked models support both CDMA and GSM bands"". This was not clear until purchase. Be careful."
Iphone 7 Plus,Nice and Powerfull. I was full of doubts with this phone. Since have me been apple customer products for more than 15 years and for the first time i feel there was no difrence between the plus 6 . But now i have had some time with the phone using the beta 3 IOS and there is some good stuff. The camera just incredible it is beast . The nice black color looks asewome . The new home button it's different more kind of android phone. And finally the speed wow i think it is faster that my macbook air 13 inch latest model .
Iphone 7 Plus,Very good. Nice job!
Iphone 7 Plus,"Awesome phone and highly recommend it to anyone. Arrived before time, and as described!
Awesome phone and highly recommend it to anyone!!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great as described
Iphone 7 Plus,This is the ultimate iPhone I have the regular iPhone 7 but this is way superior in every way
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Excellent.
Iphone 7 Plus,the iPhone box was opened and has some finger prints on the screen . Also bad packaging.
Iphone 7 Plus,Expected more!. I get a new iPhone every year. This one is disappointing. Yes there are important internal improvements but considering the price Apple should have done more. Hopefully the new Google Pixel will be a significant competitor and drive the marketplace to greater heights. So far no one has offered the personal service of Apple. If google does that they will take a major share of Apple's market. I am willing to switch only if they offer me the service. The pixel looks first class.
Iphone 7 Plus,Amazing. I was a bit scepticle about the phone being unlocked but I must say it is 400% unlocked. I don't live in an area with at&t n those kind of big time companies I live in the Caribbean with local phone companies and it works perfectly . I'm very very very happy with my purchase. Bought from seller raydes he is amazing
Iphone 7 Plus,"Love it and I am an actual user that is moving from the Galaxy S7 Edge. Not going to do a crazy long review. Just wanted to touch on some things. First off, the phone is just great (I am not focusing on some stupid cost of part BS someone else did, but rather actual use). I still have the S7 Edge but will be selling it. The battery life on the Edge was not that great to me and I tried everything to get it to be better. The iPhone 7 Plus battery life has been so much better. My S7 was usually at 62% when I got home for lunch where as my iPhone 7 Plus is at 87% (same usage..well maybe a little more for the iPhone 7 since it is still fairly new to me). This is roughly 6 hours of being off the charger and I use it at work a lot for pictures, slo-mo video of equipment and exchange email/texting.
The speed of the iPhone 7 Plus is also top notch. Considerably faster than my S7 Edge and also my friends iPhone 6 (not 6S). The camera or dual cameras work great as did the Galaxy S7 edge. I do like the 4K video better on the iPhone 7 though and the few low light shots I took were amazingly good.
So what about the headphone jack (or lack there of). This was something I was worried about at first. I have a very nice set of quad driver headphones that I use daily at the track. I wasn't about to invest in another set of headphones and give these up. When I found out they were including the adapter I said ""What the hell..I will give it a try"". The adapter is very flexible which is a good thing. The connection to the lightning port is solid and using it with my headphones was no issue at all. Actually I don't know this for a fact, but I questioned whether that port is supplying more power to them. Quad drivers need decent power (for the most part) to get sound volume and good quality. The S7 Edge sucked for this. The iPhone 7 Plus allowed me the highest volume yet and the audio quality at that high volume was right on. Again, I don't know if the phone is just pushing more power to them, but it is distinctly better.
I am not going to go on and on about this phone, but pretty much all other items. The new home button, pressure sensitive screen (although I know this isn't the first iPhone to have that), stereo speakers etc are just done extremely well.
The OS? Well I was a super moderator in an Android forum and know all the arguments both ways. I will say that the integration with all apps on iOS is just much more fluid. Sure, you do have some limitations, but when it works so well, why does that really matter?
I do have to ask some iPhone regulars. Has Apple made a lot of changes to their keyboard over the past couple of years? I just find the typing on this phone to be extremely accurate and it just feels right. As a matter of fact, I just went to take the proof picture and typed on the Edge for the first time since getting the iPhone. Not fun at all!!!

Call me a Apple Sheep or whatever you want, but I assure you I am not a die hard of any system. The iPhone 7 Plus combined with iOS 10 is just plain out superior to anything else out there!! IMHO

For the record I have the iPhone 7 Plus 128GB in Black (not jet black). I also have the Apple leather cover on it which works very well.

On a side note....iOS 10 messaging is a fricken blast!!! If you just installed iOS 10 and have not watched a Youtube video to learn all the new features you need to do it. And...if you own an older iPhone and you are not able to long press on the send arrow to get to more features, go to settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Make sure Reduce motion is set to OFF. Then you will be able to get to things like invisible ink, fireworks, etc.

Pictures are only to prove I own both. Not meant to show what anything looks like since they are low grade photos.

Enjoy"
Iphone 7 Plus,"The new home button only works with bare hands, etip & rubber gloves wont work. I HAVE TO TOUCH THE HOME BUTTON W/BARE HANDS

This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone. No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves. None of them work with my phone. So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind. Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold! I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone.

SOLUTION

I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:

Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on.

This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot. Then to unlock your iPhone 7:

1. Press the sleep button on the right of the phone.
2. Press the Assistive Touch dot.
3. Touch the home button.
4. Enter your SIX digit pass code.

Okay, so now I feel better, but I still want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into ALL THE EXTRA STEPS each time you want to open the phone.

OTHER CONS

1. I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard. It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5. Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen. I have tried it on every sensitivity level.
2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works. Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over.

I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects."
Iphone 7 Plus,"The phone is normally brand new, nothing special. But I have required for original receipt twice, and seller can't even provide any proof of the purchase of this iPhone."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Disappointing. Slow. Worse reception than the 6. AT&T says the iPhone 7 can't handle multiple apps running at the same time or else it will switch to 4G instead of their LTE network. So compared to my iPhone 6, I have to now keep closing out all the other apps that may be running in order to get the one I'm using currently to work correctly. I haven't actually tried this....but we'll see. I'm leaning towards them not really knowing what they're talking about.

Apple claims the battery lasts much better. I'm not sure I can notice a difference between the 6 and the 7 in the longevity of the battery. I guess I can only say I'm happy it didn't get worse.

The processor seems slow. I was looking forward to these fast speeds that eliminating the headphone port was supposed to alllow. Again, I don't seem to notice any improvement over the 6. In fact I almost feel like my 6 is faster than the 7.

At the moment, I'm a little underwhelmed by my the new phone. It looks the same..but performs worse. I only upgraded because AT&T had a promotion that got me a free phone if I exchanged my 6 for it.

I got in a pool with my iPhone 6..hopefully the 7 will prevent me from killing my phone that way again."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Improvements over the iPhone 6+!! The iPhone 7 Plus offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S Plus. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note.

- Better display (wider colour gamut)
- Better taptic engine
- 4 grams lighter
- IP67 Water and dust resistance
- Way better A10 Fusion CPU
- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p)
- Rear wide angle lens have OIS, telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS. Bummer!
- Better low light performance
- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE
- Slightly better battery life
- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)

The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S plus after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note.

The telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS which is disappointing. Images taken on the sensor usually underperforms, especially in low light conditions due to its smaller aperture size. Pictures taken on the telephoto lens is also usually slightly blurred.

People also reported on the hissing issues on the 7 Plus model specifically that can be captured when recording video/audio when the CPU/GPU is under load. Not all phones have this problem and for me, I just can hear a slight humming sound coming from the phone.

Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Phone is great. It is brand new and sealed. Phone is great. It is brand new and sealed, but it does not have any great difference with IPhone 6s lol."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Some improvements, but doesn't blow me away anymore at this price! This iPhone does not bring very significant changes to the 6S Plus. This time round I bought this phone from Apple with AppleCare so that I can change it out for a new one next year when Apple launches a redesigned iPhone - it's rumored they will do a full redesign for the 10th anniversary. However, it is a bit too expensive as most carriers have now dropped the discounts they used to offer on new iPhones.

I justified the exorbitant price given that I use my phone for at least eight hours a day, and not only text, call, tweet, Instagram or email but also read business documents and books and watch TV so I bit the bullet and got it on the installment plan. (It's 0% interest, and allows to exchange the phone next year, or you can pay 24 interest free installments and keep the phone, if you switch out then the cycle of 24 months begins again.)

What I love about this iPhone 7 Plus so far:
- Blazing fast, a performance improvement from 6S Plus, top-heavy apps download in seconds
-256 GB is great, I hated having to delete pictures off all the time so that I could take some more
- Black (matte) is great for viewing videos, screen is sharper and shows such great detail, it's amazing. If you're streaming HD you'll be blown away at the difference between HD movies on 6 Plus and 7Plus - you can see film quality detail, it's great. A higher resolution screen now shows pics in great detail. There is a Zoom setting that you can enable when you're setting up the phone as the sharper screen has made the letters finer, and more can fit on the screen.
- Home button is now Taptic feedback and it's very easy to get used to the new format. So a light touch on the home button now produces a knock from inside, like an Android rather than having to depress the button. This has helped me immensely as I used to press too hard earlier and bring up Siri all the time, it could be very disconcerting in a meeting.
- The lag for TouchID is reduced, this is important as I use it not only for opening the phone but for Apple Pay, Visa checkout and use TouchID for all my bank logins. Much safer on unsecured networks, I hope.
- Dual Speakers make it easier to watch videos with no headphones as it's louder
- EarPods seem to sound better, but they're still uncomfortable in my ears after 30 minutes. The lightning connector Headphones work on all my previous iOS devices. It's nice that Apple gave the little accessory to connect mono audio jack but what's with the tiny stuff. I'm so mystified since the tiny attachments of Apple Pencil!
- And finally the Dual camera- it takes really sharp pictures much sharper than my iPhone 6 Plus up to the 2X magnification. The lowlight performance is also better. I am waiting for the next iOS 10.1 update to really see the ability of the portrait mode that was showcased during the launch keynote. It's also better for low light and pets as I'm getting sharper images of my dog who cannot sit still even for a second. However, I took my selfie and since this camera is so improved, I'm getting almost DSLR quality results. Now I can actually do my makeup with the selfie camera on! The flash is also now metered to 3 different levels rather than one.
- Water resistant - although my 6S also survived a few seconds in a river- I expect more from 7 Plus.
- And one more thing, the 7 Plus is rumored to have extra RAM (2GB?) and that makes it really, really fast. The webpages are up in an instant - the movies stream with no jitters, no more tapping my feet while waiting for something to load like with 6 Plus! Some apps can't handle the improvements, and I see weird crashes but I am sure the developers of those apps will fix it soon.

Some stuff has improved due to iOS10 - love the new messaging enhancements, new Home app, the enhancements in the Health app, force touch is now better than ever, some keyboards have been added and I'm loving the Hinglish keyboard.

What I don't like:
-Not a major redesign. Yes there is better speed, a better camera, a better screen but not a major change from 6S Plus, but for me it's way more expensive as the carrier discounts are gone. To get a big discount I have to turn in my old phone, and get locked into a 2 year contract with a 30 month installment plan, no way!
- I'm ready for no audio jack, as I mainly use Bluetooth headphones but I would have to carry this tiny accessory around for my Bose headphones that I like using. I hope some accessory manufacturers come up with something smarter.
- I can't charge and listen to the music at the same time as both use lightning connector, this is crazy as I use this feature a lot at work as my Bluetooth headphones sometimes can't sync properly with YouTube audio. If anyone knows a fix please post in comments.
- There has been no redesign of the iPhone charger plug or the lightning cord! By this time I expected a better cord that doesn't break easily, or wireless charging that actually works, and a charger that is more compact or at least charges 3X times faster like some newly designed Android chargers
- The phone is still a little too big for my grip with a protective case on it, I really wish they had improved on the screen to bezel ratio. The bezel needs to disappear.

Overall it's still a nice phone, and it's better than the previous version, but I expect something more revolutionary from Apple. This was more of an enhancement than complete innovation."
Iphone 7 Plus,overpriced. overpriced. costs apple $200.
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. k lol
