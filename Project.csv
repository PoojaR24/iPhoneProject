iPhone 8,"Worked perfectly.Ordered “Like New”, unlocked 256gb iPhone 8 from meow-tronics. Came without the original box, as described, with an original Apple charging block and cable. Phone had some barely noticeable wear on the corner of the screen, but is otherwise perfect. Worked fine when I transferred my SIM card from iPhone SE on MetroPCS. Definitely would recommend buying from this seller."

iPhone 8,"zero. hi sr. my iphone 8 suddenly restart when i play in facebook, instagram, and my camera doesn't work"
iPhone 8,Five Stars. Arrived on time and as expected
iPhone 8,"iPhone 8 is superior to iPhone X. I originally purchased an iPhone X but after 10 days the novelty wore off, and I switched it for the iPhone 8. Here’s why.

Touch ID on the iPhone 8 is faster and easier to use than Face ID - and enables me to open my phone before it leaves my pocket. I was also worried about the impact of Face ID which beams infrared laser dots into my eyes 30 times a day (10,000 times a year).

I prefer the rectangular screen of the 8 to the one on the X with its curved corners and weird inset.

Best of all, I can orientate my iPhone 8 simply by feeling the touch ID button - even in the dark or in a pocket. I can also see exactly how much battery percentage I have left, and closing apps is a snap compared to the X.

The iPhone 8 is brilliant - it's fast, simple and familiar to use. By comparison, the iPhone X feels gimmicky because its so-called innovations make it harder to use."
iPhone 8,One Star. the phone was not working and it was not unlocking.
iPhone 8,DONT BUY the iphone 8 isnt as water proof as you think i bought one and took it under water following the guidlines for wayer use and my charging isnt working as well and the water can damage the speakers
iPhone 8,One Star. Missing item
iPhone 8,"Wish I hadn't upgraded from 6s. I traded up from a 6s ,and I wished I hadn't.It's constantly freezing.I switch to numerals or caps, and I tap and tap ,nothing happens.Not everytime ,but enough to annoy me.There are a lot of minor inconveniences to numerous to mention.I'm on Sprint ."
iPhone 8,Four Stars. It is what I expected.
iPhone 8,"VOID SCAM. Do not buy, came scratched and got in a boot loop after 2 weeks of using. would never buy again"
iPhone 8,"Constantly updates new features that I cannot turn off or remove. Software update descriptions do not accurately describe new features added to the phone. Initial purchase includes all of Apple's features turned on by default. Just really irritated I have a computer I own and pay the complete price of, and I have no say in what is downloaded unto my phone."
iPhone 8,"i'm commenting just like them. Iphones are reliable and have a nice. I will be sincere. Since there are many Android fans here and nobody removes their worthless reviews, i'm commenting just like them.
Iphones are reliable and have a nice camera. PERIOD."
iPhone 8,Five Stars. Good
iPhone 8,One Star. Bad
iPhone 8,Four Stars. Excellent phone
iPhone 8,Great phone! Excellent purchase. I have Verizon and everything worked great. Much cheaper than brand new!
iPhone 8,Dont buy it espacially from fullfilment because ı bought 810 dollars and pay also register tax to My country but its left speaker doesnt work and when i mentioned this issue to Amazon they dont want to give any refund more than %10
iPhone 8,"Phone has stopped working. Do not buy from this seller, the phone doesn't last. Less than a year and the phone has stopped working. Very disappointed."
iPhone 8,"Original and function product. New and original product, working perfectly. Very satisfied!"
iPhone 8,Beware of fake ones. Received a fake iPhone. No joke. Complete dummy phone.
iPhone 8,IPhone unlocked. The IPhone is fully unlocked
iPhone 8,Five Star. Thumbs up!
iPhone 8,Five Stars. Still using it
iPhone 8,Five Stars. Good quality.
iPhone 8,Five Stars. This is great until I can afford a 10
iPhone 8,Five Stars. Excellent
iPhone 8,doesn't not work. first of all the phone itself looks weird. I'm not sure if it locked or no but it did not work with Verizon
iPhone 8,"This phone is incredibly overpriced. The only reason I purchased it is because it was a gift for a dear friend who had a 5 year old I phone 5 and although these phones tend to give you four years of good usage and be relatively high quality, the price is absolutely ridiculous and id never buy one myself. Id give it two stars if they didnt last as long as they tend to, but id rather keep buying my 100 dollar unlocked Android smartphones from walmart every four years and save myself a ton cash."
iPhone 8,"Died after a month, no support from Apple.After a month of use, it bricked itself overnight. Wouldn't take a charge, wouldn't respond to any input, wouldn't respond to the side button or the hard reset combo. As if that wasn't bad enough, I tried to make an appointment at the local Apple store to get it looked at, they had a TEN DAY wait.

Lesson learned: Don't buy an Apple phone if you want any level of support from the manufacturer."
iPhone 8,"Go for it... It's an apple. Apple the brand name itself reassures u that the product will be worthy of every penny u spend... I am not an applE user yet I have seen alot of my frnds who use apple ... 4 , 5 ,6 ,7 ,8... All of then are proud of owning one , not only proud but also happy to be using one. The performance apple pack is every time 5 years ahead of its competitors . I being an Android user ,  is without doubt unhappy. I find apple the best over any of its leading competitors . They may boast of more gbs, MPs , but u can just simply say it's not an APPLE.  4s can do better than many of the android phones............ If u have the bucks go for apple. Nothing else.... Even it's resale value is great that u can upgrade to the newest apple the next yeaR without much trouble if u r a tech savvy...

Simply go for it.....

Waiting for the day , when I will also buy one.....

Ya maybe A 13s ... "
iPhone 8,"Same Old..same old! Really Apple?! I checked it out and played with it. There is nothing at all “different” about this iPhone then an iPhone 4...from what...2009?
How is this innovation? I don’t understand it. I have owned iPhones, windows phones, and android phones over my life. Android and YEAH WINDOWS phones have MADE HUGE improvements...what the F has Apple done? I’m over Apple and they’re over hyped nonsense phones! Google or windows now! The pixel 2 ...Samsung...and Windows lumia 950 or Hp Elite X3...ALL DESTROY this iphone!
Apples software is outdated...ugly...boring...and behind the times now! Apple needs a complete makeover...and an actual new “THING”...believe me...”one last thing”...it is NOT!!!"
iPhone 8,Total Garbage. Horrible product right out of the box. Going back to Samsung
iPhone 8,Great Quality Product. Thank You! 
iPhone 8,Perfect!
iPhone 8,"Nothing but problems. Nothing but trouble. Now got so hot, it burned my hand. Had insurance . Getting new one"
iPhone 8,Everything was Perfect and as described.
iPhone 8,"Good Purchase.Good product, very clean and like new. I have been using the phone for weeks and it doesn’t have any issues. I am happy with the phone and would recommend the seller"
iPhone 8,Great
iPhone 8,This phone is the best I've ever had and the price is the reason I bought it. Very happy
iPhone 8,"Perfect condition, super fast delivery.
I am very satisfied with this iphone. I could barely tell any sign of usage, and it's indeed unlocked. Also many thanks to Just N Case for the amazingly fast delivery :)"
iPhone 8,"Not happy.
The phone was network locked and not as advertised apart from that it was perfect"
iPhone 8,Light Weight and durable
iPhone XS,"I got the iPhone XS and returned it 3 hrs. later. I'm a filmmaker by trade and thought this could be a breakthrough in filmmaking especially with a high-end 4k camera on board. I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40. Now I'll do a review on that as well but the IPhone XS doesn't even come close to the LGV40 in any shape or form."
iPhone XS,"Stolen item!!! Phone had been reported stolen by AT&T and stopped working. This seller obviously sells incompetent items.
"
iPhone XS,niiiiice. i love it
iPhone XS,"Seriously?Face ID is the worst part of this phone and it ruins the whole experience. There are so many times that fingerprint ID worked and Face ID doesn’t that the overall experience is just significantly less than the 8 was. The Wow of the larger screen/small bezels is short lived once you find out how many different odd ways you have to deal with not having a fingerprint reading Home button. At work I would get a notification on my 8, touch the home button and it was great. Now I get the notification and either have to pick the phone up or hit the screen until the passcode screen appears. With Touch ID I almost never had to enter the passcode and now I have to enter it all day long. If that weren’t annoying enough so many Landscape only apps have to have a white bar across the bottom of the screen to remind you that the only way Home is to swipe that edge. It just seems like they wanted to get rid of the Home button soooo badly that they were forced to make it work. Face ID does work—it’s as good as Windows Hello on my laptop—but it just can’t replace the Home button or Touch ID. It should be an addition to not replacement for. On the plus side—the screen looks great. Would have been great in an 8 with the new processor. Another “plus” is that my cracked back glass is not flaking apart. Gorilla Glass need gorilla glue. No I would not recommend this to a friend."
iPhone XS,"It's an iPhone. It's going to have amazing build quality, an amazing screen, Apple quality iOS, tons of features and a top quality camera. It's amazing! It is almost identical to the iPhone X of 2017, but there are a few very subtle differences. The main difference in this years model, the XS has the new A12 processor that does some insane processing that is basically what a desktop computer could do a few years back (and then some)... but this is in a phone. Pretty crazy!

These phones are also pretty expensive. If this phone wasn't going to be covered by my job, I wouldn't have gotten one. I'd rather spend my money on a full size laptop. But it is what it is. An Apple product. So... good job Apple.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I held on to my iPhone 6s as long as I could but the battery life was beginning to fade quickly so I finally decided to upgrade to the Xs. This phone is so fun and easy to use! I thought not having a home button would make it harder to control but everything is very smooth and easily accessible. The facial recognition is great and very smart, the camera is clear and takes great pictures, and the speaker has nice volume and great quality sound. The phone is also more durable than any other phone I’ve had and I finally feel comfortable using a light case with no screen protector instead of an otter box. I also love how long the battery lasts! I can use my phone all day long and still have about 30-40% at the end of the day.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I should have never left Apple for Samsung. After years of Android, the whole Note and S Pen thing really looses it's allure and is more of a novelty. I was quickly reminded how well Apple streamlines all the aspects of the phone, apps, contacts, settings, email, etc. I can go on. The battery life is great. I left the house at 4am yesterday, came back at 6pm, still had 36% left. The glass backing feels sturdy, and the processor is really fast, especially noticeable on my Arlo app, which lagged on my Note 8.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Great upgraded iPhone! Much impressed with the battery life. It far exceeds previous models and with multiple apps open, I can get through the day without charging.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"So far iPhone XS has been good. Definitely different getting use to the way the phone works. But seems to be great ! 

Also little hesitant on scanning my face. Lol

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus, so this was a huge step up! I didn’t see the need to get the Max with the larger full screen on the Xs. Apple doesn’t disappoint!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"the iphone 10xs is awesome and replaced my iphone 6s plus which was still in great shape just battery getting weak. the pictures on this phone are incredible.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I was afraid the new phone would feel too big but it’s perfect for a woman’s hand. 
It was super easy to figure out the new technology. I don’t even miss the home button!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I love this new iPhone and have no complaints about it at at this time. The camera is especially awesome. Best Buy also provided excellent service during the purchase process.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Although there is not much difference between the X and XS performance wise, their are some new tricks and security measures in place that make this phone the best there is out there.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"It was time to upgrade my iPhone 5 and very happy I waited. Love the screen size and camera quality. Took a while to get used to not having home button but eventually you do.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Haven’t used all the features on this phone yet but it seems to process quicker than old phone. Battery life has been better than old phone. I’ve only charged it 3 times in the past week.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I love the big screen - quickly got used to not having a home button & love, love the camera upgrade from my prior Iphone 6s. Battery life is also great - back to charging every other day.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I love this phone! I moved from the iPhone 6 to the XS and couldn't be happier. The new interface and facial recognition are easy to use and work flawlessly. For me it is the perfect choice,

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I had the 8plus for a year and did not like the size of it. So, when I was able to upgrade to the XS, I did. It takes adjusting too, but overall, it has been great. I haven't had any issues.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I got this phone late Oct. and I've absolutely enjoyed everything about it. The camera is awesome and quality is great. Battery could be a little better, but other than that great phone.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I love the camera on this phone. Learning curve for this phone from my older version was not as difficult as I anticipated. The store staff were very helpful in going over different phone options.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I updated from an iPhone 7plus to the iPhone Xs. The facial recognition is great - very fast!! This phone is an amazing upgrade from the 7plus! Great camera!! If you are ready to upgrade, this is the phone!!!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"now i get my huge screen without having a phone too big for my pockets or hands. though a pop socket is highly recommended the phone fits well in hand and is lightening fast, just waiting for 5g in the bay area

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I previously had the 6S and was in need of an upgrade. Really liking this phone so far. The updated tech makes for a quick and smooth experience running and switching between apps. I’m also liking the FaceID. Would recommend!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I skipped a couple of the newer iPhone versions as the upgrade just wasn’t enough to justify the price. This model is certainly quite expensive for a phone but I do like it. Beautiful display, nice camera, nice interface, no more home button.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"The Apple XS iPhone was a change from the Apple iPhone 6X. After a few days I adapted to the phone without the home button. The apple phone is very easy to use and works great. I have the phone for about four weeks and I would recommend it to anyone.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Sleek, stylish, and fast! the camera is amazing and the screen immerses you into being lost with any app you use. social medias are refreshingly fun and games along with emails and txting have a new feel and are exciting. love the phone but get a case ASAP!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Had the iphone x. The xs is a little faster, just enough to notice on everyday stuff. Other than that it's the same phone since I'm not much into photography, games or AR stuff. I suspect gamers etc. will see a bigger jump in performance with the new neural engine.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"So far so good. Still miss the button at bottom of iPhone and having the touch recognition entry but it’s not terribly difficult to get into phone. I keep taking accidental screenshots of my lock screen and activating Siri due to button placement on phone though.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I finally upgraded my iPhone 5s to a 10s. Wow! What a big difference. As expected, the iPhone is very user friendly. I love the camera. Portrait mode is awesome. With the spread sheet, power point, and word-like apps, I'm wondering why I still need a laptop.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"This is a great upgrade from my old iPhone. Love the battery length along with the screen. Still learning to get used to not having a home button but the Face ID is convient for unlocking various apps. Overall this is a great new phone and I’m enjoying learning all it can do.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"This is definitely the least exciting S release that Apple has made. Outside of some camera changes, there is really nothing better for the general user of the XS over the X. 

There's nothing wrong with the phone itself. Its a great piece of hardware. Its just not innovative.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I traded up from an iPhone 8, very happy with this new equipment. Still learning the functions, but to date I have been totally amazed with the capabilities of this iPhone. I will consider upgrading again if and when there are any major changes to this product. Time will tell.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"This is by far the best iPhone that I've owned. It's facial recognition has exceeded my expectations and the phone is a lot quicker in responding and with loading apps. I really enjoy having the same size screen as the iPhone 7 +, in a smaller form factor.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Had the Note 8. Had software issues and had it replaced 3 times. Decided it was time for a switch. So I went with the xs and love it. Have had it for about 3 weeks now. A smaller phone by far. Has great battery life. I get at least 18hrs and still have 10-15% left when I Go to charge it.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Purchase iPhone X’s, upgraded from iPhone 7. Adjusting to changes, I’m appreciative of speed and enhanced features. I do wish the price was less, however I’m entrenched in Apple eco-system. The reps assisting at BestBuy were very supportive and made the transaction so smooth. Very courteous!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I upgraded from 7s so this phone has exceeded my expectations in terms of display resolution and camera quality. I have a car that allows wireless charging so this feature is very convenient for me. On the flip side, battery life is poor. I feel like I’m constantly charging he phone which I thought I would be doing less of. Overall great phone but you will have to bear more charging sessions.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Led screen is unreal! The screen goes all the way to the edge of the phone. Camera is awesome! Didn’t know if I would like it without the main button on the front. After about five minutes. Realized should of been this way the whole time. Only bad thing. I wouldn’t even say it’s a con. But the whole phone is glass! Very fragile! Feel like I’m holding a crystal egg! Get the Apple insurance and get a good case!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Purchased the phone, and since it doesn't have the home key it is different to use. I really like the home key because it was easy to use. Trying to swipe the screen takes a little patience and practice. Once you get it, it works good. Picture quality is really awesome. Anytime you always upgrade to another phone there is something that is better, Otherwise happy with our purchase just wished it was not so expensive.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"The phone is great except that it either has slow or no connection. Apps constantly open to the no connection screen. I’m on Verizon and have never experienced this before. I’m putting my SIM card back in my pixel 2. I thought I was paying for 40 percent better connection speeds, instead this is by far the slowest connection on any phone I’ve used in years. Other than waiting a minute for websites to download, hello 2009, it’s a beautiful piece of tech.

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I always loved Apple for its clean and slick looks. Upgrading from the iPhone 7 Plus to this phone was a great move for me. The specs overall are better and what really made me switch was the Dual SIM. Traveling a lot and now being able to use one phone and add in an EU sim will really make everything more convenient. I’m still getting used to the no home button and facial recognition, but overall I’m happy with the upgrade.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"My only regret would be that I did not get the XS Max (I couldn’t justify the extra $100). While the screen of the XS is bigger than that of a Plus, the screen is actually just longer and narrower, therefore when playing certain apps in landscape mode, the screen is even smaller than the Plus because there is a black border on the bottom of the screen to show the swipe up to home gesture. Other than that, the camera is great and the gestures make me not miss the home button at all.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Previous phone was a 6S so loving that the XS is so much faster! The only thing I don’t like is face recognition. The thumbprint worked so much better. Face recognition is about 50% at best. I’ve deleted and added my face multiple times but nothing seems to improve its efficacy. I’ve had to change my passwords on bank and credit cards multiple times due to too many attempts to sign on - super frustrating!! I wish they would bring back the thumbprint !

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I have used iPhone 5s and 6. This new Xs is simply amazing. I wanted a larger screen , but not a lager phone. This one is perfect. The entire front is screen, but it’s the same size as my 6. The new iOS 12 is an outstanding operating system as well. The new cameras on this phone are light years ahead of the competition. I love the convinience of Apple tech keeping my iPads and iMac computers up to date. I highly recommend this new phone. The price is well worth it.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I purchased the Apple iPhone XS for my daughter to replace her iPhone 5. She and her husband have invested themselves in Apple products. I personally do not like Apple because of thier proprietary systems and lack of interoperability with android or Microsoft products. I also believe that Apple charges way too much for their proprietary products. However, as far as the iPhone XS goes, it is a really nice smartphone, like most all Apple products are. My daughter likes her new iPhone XS and its interoperability with all of her and her husband's Apple products.

iPhone XS,Awesome camera! This product is perfect!
iPhone XS,"I went from an iPhone 6s to the new XS and wow what a difference. Went in store for the upgrade, everything went smooth. Had the phone 2 weeks and no complaints

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I had a learning curve since I am use to a Samsung but so far I like it except for some of the apps are different or apple charges for what is free on androids

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"AMAZING new phone. Like the facial recognition. It works really well. Haven't really used the camera yet but looking forward to seeing the quality of pictures.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I upgraded from iPhone 7 and the difference is notable. Large screen (but not as large as the Max version, which is very bulky). Very quick response.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I upgraded from the IPhone 8 and I love it! Def would not recommend upgrading from the X, but upgrading from any other iphone is totally worth it if it’s an option.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I switched from Android because of the camera. It really lives up to its hype. That said, the phone is still an Apple product, complete with all Apple annoyances.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"I love the larger screen! Took some time to get used to not having a home button but it is now user friendly! Love the photo quality and new apps!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"There isn’t words to describe how awesome the camera is on the new iPhone! I switched from the iPhone 7 and it’s a huge difference definitely worth the price!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Don’t bother. Waste of money. More frustrating to use than the last version. No real new features.

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Seems like everytime apple comes out with a new phone the older one slows down working

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Much heavier then the iPhone 6s, 7 and 8. Not liking the all glass back as well.

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"Nice display and speed. Some issues with calls and Bluetooth connecting in the car.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS,"After using iPhone for more than 4 years.. I actually don't feel any difference , becaiuse I transferred everythimg from my old phone and it's the same UI. But the new features are there and the camera is good and it's so smooth to use.. battery is good too.. consistent 6+ screen on time hours for every 100%.. I love it.. though there are so many android phones with other features.. I find this long lasting and durable.. I would like to recommend this to a friend."

iPhone XS Max,"Large Screen, Not for Single-Hand Use"
iPhone XS Max,"Happy Happy Joy Joy.I was mostly content with my iPhone X but always wished it was a little bigger. The XS Max fits the bill. Biggest iPhone screen ever but in the same body size virtually as the Plus models is exactly what I wanted. Excellent display. Face ID , which worked perfectly for me already appears to be faster and more accurate ( I didn’t have issues often with Face ID not working like some people say they have though so it’s just a perk of an upgrade versus an issue being fixed). Gold color is gorgeous. iOS 12 is great. 

Only negative I have come across is that the XS/XS MAX does not work with my Belkin stand charger. It constantly cycles as if it isn’t staying plugged in. Researched and found out that it is listed as not compatible. Not sure if Belkin will be able to address the issue or if it’s now just an accessory I can no longer use. Oh and for those that still need it you won’t get the headphone adapter included in the XS/XS Max package. You will have to purchase one if you need it."
iPhone XS Max,"A joy to use, reliable, fast, great screen."
iPhone XS Max,Best Bestbuy Purchase ever
iPhone XS Max,"finally.I love my xs max stupid name but I love the phone they apple finally made a ""plus"" phone and coming from the regular iPhone x its a nice upgrade if you have huge hands like myself battery life is hit and miss and unlike some people I haven't had any connection issues if your an iPhone person that wants a huge screen this is the phone for you and I came from a Galaxy Note 9 and its a great for if your an android person that said I have nothing bad to say about it I switched over because of my job .

Pros
6.5 Screen with the same size as iPhone 8 plus
LOUDSPEAKERS
new color 
Waterproofing is IP68 

CONS
Big screen might be overwhelming 
battery life as I mention is hit and miss"
iPhone XS Max,"Zero regrets! I upgraded to the XS Max from a 7 Plus. the phone is virtually the same size but there is a huge difference in screen size. I'd thought about going w/ the smaller XS to experience a smaller phone, but at the last minute decided to go with the XS Max...a decision I definitely do not regret. The screen is enormous and beautiful - great to watch videos or TV. I find myself using my iPad less and less. I was also a little skeptical if I'd be happy with faceID vs the fingerprint sensor but my skepticism was unfounded. faceID is so easy to use and makes the overall experience much better. Only in very bright light have I had any issue and had to fall back to typing in my code, but even that has been rare. It is blazing fast, and with the awesome screen size and faceID, I could not be happier with this phone."

iPhone XS Max,"iPhone XS Max.I get a new iPhone every 2 years. I never get those so-called mid new releases. I laughed at the iPhone X when it came out and I seen it. This XS Max isn’t that. Trust me! This is why I only upgrade, every 2 years only! I told myself, if they don’t make any extreme changes, that I would be keeping my 7 Plus. I was the first to have the iPhone XS Max. Best Buy was giving them out at 8 AM. Before the cellphone stores. It’s a refreshing change. I’m just wondering, what took them so long? It’s extremely expensive though. Lots of improvements! Great phone. Apple has always been good at taking what’s out there and making it better!"
iPhone XS Max,"Best iPhone Ever.I contemplated getting the regular XS but compared screen size when playing video and for me the XS Max won it out!
After having the iphone 5S , 6 and 7 plus now having the 
XS Max , I can honestly say the XS Max is the best iPhone ever.
Its fluid and very easy to use. I personally like the size and the pictures are amazing. 
The battery could be a little better but nonetheless it still holds just enough juice until the next charge.
The speaker is clear and antenna seems to get a better and clearer reception. Calls are clear and the overall feel is exceptional.
I'd recommend the new iPhone XS Max to anyone looking for a new level of experience on the latest iPhone.

 "
iPhone XS Max,"More Screen!Coming from the iPhone 8 Plus, I am very happy with the iPhone XS Max due to the screen real estate. In my opinion, this is an improved model of the 8 Plus since the physical size is nearly identical. As usual, navigation in iOS is smooth and consistent even with the newly released iOS 12. Personally, I don’t love the notch and wish it was excluded from this model, but you forget about it after a while. I had the previous iPhone X for a very brief time because it was just way too small for my hands. This is a fantastic incremental upgrade even at the steep asking price. The gold on this years iPhone is my favorite gold yet."

iPhone XS Max,"Love the screen size! I was not a fan of the size of the iPhone X, so I was glad Apple decided to make the Max- it is perfect for us big phone lovers. I remember reading certain reviews before I got the phone that compared the Max to an iPad Mini, which made me nervous because no one wants a phone as big as a tablet. But it’s perfect, just like my Plus but a better screen which makes watching videos and reading on the phone so much more enjoyable. It was easy to adjust to having no home button, which was another concern of mine before getting the phone. Overall very pleased with all the new features. I love the phone!"
iPhone XS Max,"Great Phone.For me this was a legitimate upgrade coming from the 6s Plus. The camera and battery life are the most impressive. before applying batt life saving tips from the net the phone would last the full length of the day while playing games sporadically and constant use of texting, emails, and trips to social medias. Now, with the batt saving tips the phone lasts all day and all night until I plug it in to go to sleep. recommend getting a case and screen protector ASAP. amazing technology but would not be worth the investment if upgrading from previous gen."
iPhone XS Max,"Switch from Android.I have had Android phones since smartphones started. The new iPhone has been very reliable and a big step up from my Samsung Galaxy 8+. The battery lasts all day, performance is great and the face ID is flawless even at night. The camera is also a huge improvement over the Samsung. It did take a little time to get used to IOS vs Android but so far I am really liking how everything works. I also got the watch and I must say the 2 devices work really well together. Much better then the Samsung phone and watch."
iPhone XS Max,"After my iPhone X was stolen (my fault completely for setting it down on restaurant table) I then went to bestbuy the next day and purchased a New iPhone XS Max. The speed when it comes to fb, games or just surfing the web on the iPhone XS Max is Amazing (big difference between x and XS). Kind of Glad my iPhone X was stolen bc if not I probably would have not gotten my hands on this phone also Although I have apple protection plan, I always protect my phone with the best cases I can find which in this case Otterbox seems only right. Thank you Bestbuy once again."
iPhone XS Max,"A worthy upgrade.I upgraded from the iPhone X for the larger size and better battery life. This is a beautiful phone. I would recommend for anyone looking to upgrade from an older model iPhone. The speed is amazing. Photos are outstanding.
Just make sure you buy a case and screen protection. I would suggest a glass protector. I bought a Belkin from Apple and they installed it with their machine at their physical store. The protector is expensive ($40.00 yikes!), but knowing it will be perfectly aligned will give you peace of mind."
iPhone XS Max,"Truly the best phone available.his review is from Apple - iPhone XS Max 256GB - Silver

I am sure there's not much I can say that hasn't been said but this is truly the finest phone I have ever used.

Speedy. Gorgeous screen. The Camera effects are unbelievable. iOs 12.X continues to improve on the most efficient mobile operating system out there,.

CONS: Clearly not inexpensive. At this rate, Apple will have $2,000 phones in a few years :(

Battery life seems somewhat less than my 7 Plus.

Overall, feels great in the hand. Looks beautiful. Performs better than my Mac Mini :P"
iPhone XS Max,"The best. The best phone on the market. Using the phone with other Apple devices in the Apple ecosystem is a plus. The camera is awesome and the OLED display is vibrant. The speakers sound great. I receive a lot of laughs with the animoji characters. The Face ID seems to work well and having no home button is something you will get used to.

I skipped the first X iteration as I was in the middle of my contract and wanted to see the FaceID technology mature a little more. Overall, this is another great phone by Apple and I recommend it."
iPhone XS Max,"Better than I thought! I love this phone! It is faster than my iPhone 7 Plus and I don't miss the home button at all, and I thought I would! There is hardly a learning curve at all regarding the missing home button. The Face ID works perfect, I LOVE IT! So far the battery has lasted me all day. The wireless charging is great! I have had no issues with charging via cord either. The only down side I have experienced is WiFi connection, it has been very spotty. I will have to go to Verizon and have that checked out. Other than that, I highly recommend."
iPhone XS Max,"Great upgrade from 6s plus.My wife bought this for me because she was tired of me complaining about the lack of space on my phone. Plus. I cracked my screen and pieces of glass were falling out of it. It is so much faster than my 6s plus. It is hard to remember and get used to the lack of a home button, I only took away a star because of my frustration of no home button and no auxiliary port. I have to buy a separate connection so I can listen to my music in the car, Other than that, it it another great apple product."
iPhone XS Max,"If you’re an apple fan and must have the latest technology then go for it but If you’re already rocking an 8 or up and low on cash I’d wait. But if you balling out of control go for it and enjoy the new Animoji’s and all the other update iOS 12 has to offer techie

iPhone XS Max,"I am in love with this phone. The screen size is amazing. Allows me to complete my business work in my phone instead of having to work on my laptop all the time. Face ID is awesome. Only thing that bothers me a little bit is the weight when I’m holding it for a long time

iPhone XS Max,"No more fumbling with a six digit code to use my phone. Just pick it up. I do miss the percentage of battery life showing. Also, instead of glancing at my phone when I get a ding for an e-mail it says notification. I have to pick it up to see what it is. Other than that, I love it.

iPhone XS Max,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6s Plus and what an upgrade it is!!!! The screen is amazing, the speakers are loud and clear, the camera blows me away. If you have an older device this is a no brainer, especially if you are coming from a Plus sized device. The white/silver looks great too!

iPhone XS Max,"The iPhone XS Max is a great choice is you are an apple person. I haven't had any issues with it. The screen size and resolution is impressive. It holds a charge really well, and recharges very quickly. Definitely recommend to others who are in the market for a new phone!

iPhone XS Max,"I love my new iPhone! all the features make it so much easier to use. I think this iPhone is the most significantly better compared to previous versions. The only thing is I wish they had a white and black color option rather than just black with the silver, gold or space gray accents.

iPhone XS Max,"I'm personally an HTC or Google guy myself but my wife is an Apple girl and was in dire need of replacing her relic of an Apple 5S. She was going back and forth between the XS and the XS Max. She is very happy she went with the Max. The text is considerably larger when reading websites or ebooks.

iPhone XS Max,"going from the ""button"" to the no button was so much easier than even I thought it would be, the camera is spot on. the price of course not so much so this phone will have to last longer than my previous one so with that said I hope that the battery turns out to be better than the last ones

iPhone XS Max,"I like the big screen and the pics this thing takes is incredible. Watching a movie with the new screen is amazing and most important, because at the end of the day it needs to make calls, the sound quality when hearing another person is excellent. The high price was a tough pill to swallow though.

iPhone XS Max,"I use this phone for everything! Hardly slows down or crashes, Maybe once in the two months I’ve owned it. I mainly use a wireless charging dock and have only had issues of fully charging when I had a thicker case and a magnet for magnetic mounting. Overall, I am satisfied. Upgraded from a 7 plus.

iPhone XS Max,"I WAS RELUCTANT TO GO BACK TO THE IPHONE AFTER BGOING TO ANDROID. BUT I'M GLAD I DID.

REMINDS ME OF THE VERY 1ST IPHONE

iPhone XS Max,"Have yet to have an issue. It's big, I like them big. I like the animoji & mimoji thing. It takes some getting used to the no home button. Camera is nice. The only thing that kinda sucks is because it's so new and big is that there are not a wide assortment of cases out which isn't a phone issue itself.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"Overall amazing phone, camera is spectacular, looks amazing and the removal of the home button seems to be a plus even thoughbit was annoying at first. Only drawback seems to be that the battery life didnt last as long as i would have hoped for the amount the phone costs. However still the best phone on the market right now.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"The XS Max has proven to be a pretty nice phone thus far. The camera abilities alone make it worth the upgrade! The price is off the charts, but I think people need to come to grips with inevitably continual rises in price of these phones as the technology keeps changing and their abilities continue to increase.

iPhone XS Max,"i’ve had an iPhone 4s, 5, 6s, 7, and 8 plus in the past, but none of them comes close to what the iPhone XS Max has in store for you. The iPhone 8 Plus was also a good buy if you’re looking for something a bit cheaper but the XS max is really amazing. Personally love the infinity screen, face recognition, and the camera!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"This is my first cellphone/smartphone and it is just terrific. The visuals and sound are great and the larger size is much more appealing than the smaller, older iPhones. I love the mobility and freedom this phone provides and I think it will pay for itself in the increased productivity it allows for . I look forward to using the camera and video a lot.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"This thing is a beast! It's gorgeous, easy to use, and a real delight. I was against Face ID at first, not because I didn't like the idea of it, but because I was unsure how well it would work when laying in bed, etc. Well, it works great! It's fast and fun to be honest. Big screen is perfect, easy to hold, very fast, excellent camera, I love this phone!

iPhone XS Max," admit, I was hesitant on purchasing the IphoneXS because of some of the reviews I had read. I was upgrading from an Iphone 5c, so it was a big jump. This phone is fantastic....a slight learning curve, but I am very happy with it. I like the bigger sized screen, which makes reading emails and text messages MUCH easier.
Very happy with my purchase.

iPhone XS Max,"The performance on this phone is amazing, battery life is great and love the fact that my screen goes all the way to the edge. The pictures taken from this phone are amazing and it comes with some new features. One thing I don't like is the fact that Apple used glass for the back again, and the phone is on the heavy side, maybe due to the big glass on the back

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"Love the upgrades. Led screen is crazy awesome. Didn’t know if I would like it without the main button on the front? Now I think it should of been this way all along. Love how the screen goes all the way to the edges. Camera is outstanding. Only bad thing. I wouldn’t even say it’s a con. But the Whole thing is glass. Very fragile. Get the Apple insurance. And get a good case

iPhone XS Max,"I’m one of the many that get a new iPhone each year. However for a few years now I haven’t felt like I’ve been getting anything different (other than a model number). This time it feels really different! Much bigger screen (having gone from the 8 plus, returned the X after an hour) and noticeable display improvement. This phone makes having a tablet unnecessary. Good job yet again, Apple.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"Face it, if you paid the price for the phone like I did, you go straight to the largest screen available. It fits great in my hands and when upgrading from a 7 Plus, I couldn’t be happier! I really enjoy the wireless charging and vivid OLED screen. I couldn’t wait for Apple to come out with their charger so I grabbed a quick charger from Samsung. I can safely say I won’t be going back to wires.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"I am definitely an Apple junkie and won’t own anything but Apple products. I am enjoying this new phone but have to say it’s a little quirky in that it requires a reboot every week or two to keep the cellular signal and other features working properly. It’s not a big deal and may change with updates but it’s not something I’ve had to do with past iPhones. Overall, though I would still recommend it!!!

iPhone XS Max,"This is my 4th iPhone but my first large display version. I love the large retina display. One reason I upgraded is for the camera. The camera quality is stunning and good enough to replace carrying a camera with me separately. I really like the ease and speed of the facial recognition. My experience with the battery is that is has actually lasted me 2 days between charges and when I do charge the phone it charges quickly.

iPhone XS Max,"I held off on getting the original iPhone X because of the reviews. However, this iPhone version has been nothing but great. I went with the iPhone XS max and glad I did. Screen size is perfect (same as Galaxy S9 plus). Camera is unbelievable and the phone is very fast when surfing the web or using apps. The screen size is what really made me go with the XS max. Some people think it's too big, but I think it is a perfect size!

iPhone XS Max,"I recently upgraded to the iPhone XS Max from the iPhone 7 Plus. The XS Max’s main feature is its immersive display. It is great to have for media consumption. It may be big for some but if you are coming from one of the older Plus size phone then it won’t be an issue. The XS Max has the same footprint as the previous Plus size phones but with the edge to edge display. The phone is very snappy all around. I am satisfied with my upgrade.

iPhone XS Max,"I recently picked up the iPhone Xs Max. I have had pretty much every iPhone since the first one. This one by far is the best yet. The screen is amazing. The speed is by far top notch. The quality is pretty much the same as any Apple product. I love the size of the screen. I have to say I had the X too but it seemed to small for me. I’m coming from a 8 Plus and this is perfect. If you can afford it why not upgrade. You won’t be disappointed.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"The screen alone is worth the upgrade. The 6.5 inch screen is just so big and beautiful, still having the reachability feature makes it manageable if you have small hands. Turning on reachability allows you to swipe down in the bottom right and brings the screen down making it easier to reach stuff up top. If you’re coming from a plus model iPhone this will feel very familiar at least size wise, if you’re coming from a smaller phone it really doesn’t feel to big.

iPhone XS Max,"This is an upgrade from the iPhone 6S Plus and the difference is astounding. The phone is light years ahead of my previous device. I pre-ordered the phone to be picked up on release day. I was a bit nervous not knowing if the devices would arrive on schedule but not only were the devices received but I received the notification the night before my pick up day. The speed if the new processor is fantastic, the color is the best I've seen on a phone. It's definitely worth the price.

iPhone XS Max,"I was hesitant to get the iPhone X when it first came out - way too much money. However, my iPhone 7 was in need of upgrade. I am so glad I got the XS Max. The 6.5” OLED full screen display is brilliant. I am really amazed at how clear videos are. 
Once I learned how to use the new touch screen - everything seamlessly flows. It is so easy to use. And the facial recognition works in the background, you don’t have to do anything special. Just pick the phone up to face level, and it unlocks automatically.

iPhone XS Max,"The iPhone XS Max is awesome! Incredible display, great sound quality, and I love the large size. I upgraded from the X just for the bigger display because the X was a great phone. I had just always wished it were a little larger. No home button is awesome, all the gestures feel so natural after only a little use. You will not miss the home button! Battery life is also better. It is simply a high quality device all around and would recommend to everyone! Also, Best Buy is a great place to do your upgrade or first time iPhone purchase!

iPhone XS Max,"The iPhone XS Max is a wonderful device that works brilliantly with Apple's ecosystem and tightly managed operating system. The camera works as advertised, the screen is beautiful, and the battery life exceeds my expectations for a phone that is used as heavily as I use mine (for both work and personal usage). 

The only downside at all is the skyrocketing prices that are now associated with flagship devices across the board. While this isn't an Apple specific issue, it does warrant a second thought before deciding to spend over 1,000$ for a smartphone.

iPhone XS Max,"So far so good with my new iPhone which was a replacement for my iPhone 6S Plus. Same size, but more screen area so able to see more. Has taken some time to get used to the swiping motion you use to open things rather than pushing the home button, but the good thing is there are no longer open pages which I would forever forget to close and then spend some time closing them all when it seemed that my battery was depleting or the phone seemed to slow down.

iPhone XS Max,"This is the best phone that I have ever owned. I used to have an apple phone back when they first came out and 3-4 models after that. Quickly I realized that apple was not making changes to screen size or functionality. That’s when I went with Android and been there ever since till this phone. Let me tell you that this max iPhone is awesome, amazing and better then android for several reasons. One reason is the apple ecosystem, it just works so flawlessly and the quality of apps is equally amazing. Overall the build quality and overall phone is very premium compared to the competitors. I recommend to anyone family and friends.

iPhone XS Max,"Bought this phone for the wife, the Gold looks pretty good this time too and apparently it is one of the more popular colors. Anyway, the highlight here is the OLED screen, which if you have never owned an OLED television or spent any time with an OLED screen the difference in colors and blacks will be a delight to you. Everything else is as you would expect from an iPhone, high quality. If you have never owned an iPhone before, this is a little pricey but if you take care of it then it will serve you 4 years pretty easily, and longer but after about 4 years you may start to notice not all apps will be compatible with it anymore (typically games and such).

iPhone XS Max,"I’m very impressed with Xs Max. The notch was something i thought about when upgrading from the 7 Plus but I have to say I’m used to it now. Also the swipe gestures and being without the home button I’m used to. It feels very natural now. The OLED screen is fantastic and the size is perfect. The battery life is improved too. I use it all day moderately and it’s still at least 50% left at night. A Very powerful and snappy phone. I only really have one negative about the phone and it’s small. I liked seeing the battery percentage always in sight but now you have to scroll down on the right to see it. Other than that small complaint. It’s a perfect phone.

iPhone XS Max,"Honestly guys I can’t express how much love I have for the new iPhone XS Max. I’ve owned an iPhone ever since the 3GS when I was 7. I’ve owned other phones along the way like Samsung’s, Sony’s, a old Windows phone. I honestly would never leave the Apple world of technology. The Face ID isn’t even an issue if you are worried about that because every app I use with a password or that uses Touch ID allows for Face ID as well, that includes USAA a Government banking app! The cameras a absolutely phenomenal as well, talk about a professional level outcome! The screen is gorgeous too, honestly the notch is unique and I like it, it doesn’t interfere or get in the way with anything.

iPhone XS Max,"This is the best iPhone I’ve had. The battery life is amazing even if I’m on it all day long it’ll still have a big amount of percentage left on it. To me, I feel it chargers pretty quickly and I don’t feel the need to buy the faster charger. Even though it doesn’t come with the small cable for the headphones, it’s only $9 to get another one so I’m not complaining. The size of the screen is also great and the colors are vibrant on it. The camera is amazing as well and it takes great pictures of everything even in low lighting. I myself think it is worth the price. If you’re not picky about the small stuff like the adapter for earphones, or for it to be charged in two seconds, then you’ll love it as much as I do.

iPhone XS Max,"iPhone XS Max is a great phone! I had the iPhone X when it first came out. I disliked it due to a few reasons, size and Techical glitches that I ran into. 

Now with the Max I absolutely love it. It’s fast, it hasn’t glitches or locked up on me. 

The camera is great for normal photos or snap chatting.

The phone service seems to work really well in most places that I go. 

The battery seems to last a while. I work through Gmail on the sarfari for my job. It gets used quite a bit during the day and I always have battery for when I am relaxing before bed. 

The facial recognition works extremely well. I haven’t had it have any issues not unlocking my phone. 

If you are an iPhone fan or looking to switch to this phone I would recommend it.

iPhone XS Max,"I was upgrading from an iPhone 6 Plus, not the 6s model, and needless to say there have been some pretty decent upgrades in 4 years as far as phones go. The best part of this upgrade, is the OLED screen. Assuming that most people have experience with an iPhone that are considering this one, 64GB is not going to be enough if you enjoy taking a lot of photos and/or videos without uploading this to a computer, online cloud options, or deleting some. Of the 64GB, the operating system takes approximately 6GB as of now, leaving you with 58GB for apps, photos, etc. Plenty for me, but just know your data usage and consider if this will be enough for you. If you have never owned an iPhone before, this is a great option that is basically a miniature laptop so take good care of it and it can last you 4-5 years pretty easy.

iPhone XS Max,"The display is what put it over the top for me and was the main reason I purchased it! The screen is just beautiful and big and that’s what I love! Coming from a plus model, I’m use to the big phones and have had one since they first introduced them, so the size doesn’t bother me at all. With it being all screen now it can be a little more challenging to reach certain parts of the screen even with big hands, but Apple still has the reachability feature on these which makes it easier. The phone feels amazing and very high quality. iOS over the last few generations lost that buttery smooth feel it use to have, Apple has definitely changed that with iOS 12. iOS 12 is a big on improvement on all hardware that will run it, but on the Xs and Xs Max with the 4GB of ram it is seemless like it use to be. These aren’t cheap phones , but they’re definitely worth it if you’re in the market for one. If I had one knock it would be that Apple still ships these with the 5w charging brick even though these phones support fast charging. This to me inexcusable for a phone of this price in 2018/19. If you like a big screen, this thing will satisfy all your needs.

iPhone XS Max,"I've had an iPhone 6 Plus for 4 and a half years and I've been very happy with it. I checked out the new phones and saw that the XS Max was the same size as my 6 Plus but the whole screen was used. So I purchased it. It works a little different than the plus (no home button, shuts off differently, among a few things), but I've gotten used to the differences and I actually prefer them. I love the Face recognition feature, and I love swiping up to get out of an app. It's a lot faster than the Plus and Siri is easier to use. I haven't had any problems charging it because I charge it wirelessly. I love that feature. Apple products are great because I can back them up to my computer and when I get a new product just restore it from the backup and everything is there. My games are where I left off, all of my texts are there. It's great. The only downside is it's a little heavier but that's nothing. So all in all, I'm really glad I bought this phone.

iPhone XS Max,"I found the new iPhone XS max not to be that much different from my iPhone 7 Plus. I am having buyers remorse. I miss the home button. having a hard time getting used of that. But it does take great pictures. That’s why I’m giving it 3 Stars.

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"The phone is what you would expect from Apple, Innovation is behind Samsung. For a $1200 phone, I was surprised that it takes so long to charge and Apple won’t admit there is an issue. If you search Google, thousands of people are having the same problem.

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"I always used an iphone, so when i had to replace my phone i got the Max 64GB, i heard that it is the best iphone ever, paid around $1200 for it, i have couple things to say about it:
1- it froze couple times in the first week, worked better after an update but still freezing in the first week is bad.
2- charging the phone is slow, i use original cable and adapter but still slow
3- the lack of finger sensor is bad

 No, I would not recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max,"I got this phone on release day. I bought the iPhone X s Max 512 gig. I’ve been an iPhone owner since the iPhone 4. So believe my I’ve owned and used many iPhones. Once they added Touch ID to the iPhone that was by far my favorite and most used feature in an iPhone ever. Now I didn’t own the iPhone X because I prefer a larger phone and it was to small for me, so this is my first time ever using Face ID and not having a finger print sensor anymore and I freaking hate it! Removing the finger print sensor makes me dislike this phone. I didn’t think it’d matter to me but it does enormously. Use to be so easy logging into my iPhone 8 Plus. And it never failed. Face ID fails for me at least 50% of the time. Don’t get me wrong thie rest of the phone is amazing to me. I love it but not having a finger print sensor ruins this phone to me. I’ll keep this phone for 2 years but if Apple doesn’t bring back some form of Touch ID in the future I think I’ll be looking elsewhere for my next phone. It’d be so easy to turn the apple logo on the back of the phone into a finger print scanner. And if it were I’d give this phone 5 stars. But getting rid of it makes me hate this phone. I did give it 3 stars cause the rest of the phone I love but bring it back apple or I’m done. Thank you.

iPhone XS Max,This phone is overpriced garbage. I purchased the phone brand new and it won’t charge sometimes leaving me with a dead phone at work. The phone is also just too large for practical use and the resolution is disappointing. I can’t believe they would slap such a large price tag on this phone without making sure it works properly. I returned and ordered a new note 8 instead. Save your money and buy a different phone.

iphone x,"
One month of regular use / covered in scratches. I want to start out by saying that I’m a binge Apple “fanboy” and own more Apple products then an average consumer.

My first impressions with the iPhone X are great despite to some annoying OS bugs and I would highly recommend the phone. The full screen OLED display is killer and it’s a must experience.

My main compliant is that my screen has a ton of scratches on it after a month of a regular use. I work in the office and I keep my phone in my pocket like most of us do. To be homesbe, my iPhkne 6s has resisted scratches for over 2 years and the X started showin scratches within the first few weeks. This is a huge disappointment and it takes away from the beautiful experience of the display. #disapointed"
iphone x,"Five Stars. 
No bad"
iphone x,"Beautiful phone with one annoying flaw. came from the 7+ which I absolutely loved but died on me after 1.5 years making the conspiracy of Apple devices intentionally slowing down and becoming hard to use plausible.

Given that, I took the plunge and since needing a phone, went with the “future proof” X. It was between the 8+ or X but given the display on the X I made the move. Do I regret it?

Pros:

Amazing display
Exceptionally fast
Beautiful design and form factor (bigger display but smaller form is very helpful)
Videos are outstanding
Camera is world class and photos amazing
Wireless charging very helpful

Cons:

Face ID works but is much slower than fingerprint sensor and a little annoying

Battery life is ok, not great, but not on par with 8+

Heats up due to glass back when doing any processes that require it

Design is beautiful but glass back makes it incredibly slippery requiring a case to hide that design

Let me just say that despite it’s amazing display, I should have gone with the 8+. The Face ID is just not on par with fingerprint sensor. It works, but requires the extra step of swiping up after looking at it. Maybe I’m just being way too picky but when you are used to just placing your thumb and opening instantly every time, it’s the one thing they just drives me crazy.

You get used to the other gestures but again, just not as simple as using the 7 or 8.

Would I buy it again? Probably not especially at the cost and extra $250 vs the 8+ which doesn’t have the screen of the X but pretty much everything else. While maybe not a big deal to some, I just can’t get past the Face ID being more of a gimmick then a necessity and I fear that’s the future of all iPhones like removal of the headphone jack."
iphone x,"starsAmazing, Stupendous Phone. Full disclosure, I bought my iPhone X yesterday at ATT. It is not the unlocked one, but as someone who was hesitant to make the switch, I wanted to write a review. I never get the latest and greatest technology. I always waited and go the ""s"" version of the new iPhone. But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price, a few negative reviews, and to be honest, the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever. I am so glad I did. This phone is amazing.

Highlights: Great battery life. On my old iPhone, a 6s, I could get about 4 hours of moderate use before I had to charge, maybe 2 hours of heavy use. I went all day with moderate to heavy use and used less than 50% of my battery. The screen is as beautiful as all the people say. I have found many of my apps have already been updated to take advantage of the screen. The new gestures are very intuitive and in less than 12 hours I was completely used to them. Facial recognition is fast and I haven't had a single issue. I am terrible at taking pictures and this phone makes me look like I know what I am doing. Though there are a lot of setting options, they are really easy to navigate through. They say this is the best
smartphone ever, and I have to agree.

Negatives: Because this is so expensive, you might be a little overprotective. And you should be. But on my wireless plan, it only increased my payment about $8 month. I don't find that to really be a negative. I haven't found anything I don't like about this phone yet.

iphone x,"Dear Apple

Dear Apple,

I was out of the country with my family on vacation when my phone got a few water drops on it and completely shut off and stopped working. At this moment, I was very upset with my phone and with Apple, but I was hopeful that I would be helped when I got back in the states. Fast forward a few days later, obviously very tough days being out of the country without a working phone, and I finally got off a plane and went straight to an apple store. Going into the apple store, I was very willing to share my story with the employees and the manager. How can Apple say a phone is water resistant up to 3 feet when it can break when it gets a few drops of water on it? I told the employees this, and they did not seem surprised at all. They basically told me it was my fault the phone broke, and I argued with them saying that apple false advertised. The employees wouldnt do much to help me, I was leaving for college the next day and needed a phone, they wanted me to pay 1,000$ for a new phone. The employees were unwilling to help, so was the manager. My experience with the Iphone X and apple in general has just been terrible. I am super fed up with apple and I really cannot believe how poorly I was treated. I have had an Iphone for the last 8 years, and the service has always been okay, but now Apple made a false claim and somehow that was my fault and I needed to pay for it. I still love the products Apple makes but I am fed up with the service and the treatment and the dishonesty."
iphone x,"For $1,200 it should work - didn't. Bought the iPhone X and immediately had problems with it. The unit wouldn't recognize cellular data, even after set-up via wifi. Ran all the tests and then reformatted it. Still nothing. Using a news reader app on wifi shouldn't take that much power, but after 10 minutes the phone was so hot I could barely hold it. Kudos to the Apple store for excellent customer service, though. For $1,200 it should work straight out of the box. It didn't. I'm not going to waste time with troubleshooting or a new one. That money is now back in my pocket."
iphone x,Three Stars.It was good
iphone x,"Would be five stars except for screen being too fragile. I bought my iPhone X from Apple, so I'm not shown as a verified purchaser by Amazon. I'd rate it 5 stars except the screen developed a hairline crack just two months after I got it even though it's never been dropped. Apple, of course, will not do anything about that since they only have my word that it hasn't been dropped. It has been in my pocket much of the time and, with that big screen, it may have stressed the screen a bit when I sat down, etc. But the screen should be able to withstand minor stresses like that! Even worse, four months later, it developed a second hairline crack, again without ever being dropped. Right now, the phone is 100% usable since I have to look very carefully to see the hairline crack, and can only see it (just barely) with a totally black screen. But I worry that this is going to get worse. I hope I am an unusual case, but found a couple of other complaints here about ""screen lifting"" and similar. It seems like Apple needs to improve the screen durability.

Other than this issue, I love the phone. The screen is big, especially compared to the physical dimensions. When my Kindle broke recently (I left it on a chair and sat on it – not wise!), instead of buying a new one I started using my iPhone X to read Kindle books. I like it even better than my old Kindle Voyage. The screen is a bit smaller, but much sharer and brighter. And ""my Kindle"" is always with me!

Camera is great, but you know that and much more from reviews. Mostly I wanted to register my concern about the screen and, if others experience the same problem, maybe Apple will respond."
iphone x,"Great Phone but NOT evolutionary! A bit overpriced for the value.Late last year Apple released their iPhone X, the 10th generation iPhone and the flagship of their line-up. When it was first announced in September 2017, there was a lot of media coverage and many people were excited for it to go on sale. It was possibly the largest change to an iPhone the world had seen, and I had to get it. Sadly, I missed the online pre-order date, therefore I ended up on the second floor of the Galleria Mall parking garage at 10:30 pm wrapped in a sleeping bag on a lawn chair. After an 11hr and 33-minute wait, I finally was able to hand Apple $1400 for the phone. But was it worth it? I love the software and user interface apple generally produces. However, for the price I paid for this phone I expected it to have a bit more of a ‘Wow-factor’, in terms of the ‘evolutionary’ technology that the device was advertised to possess. I do think that this device is a platform for them to build a lot of new and innovative technology off of, however, despite my excitement for that, the reality is that I spent a lot of money on an iPhone that doesn’t do that much more than the previous generation. The features I enjoy include: the new Face ID biometric security feature, the beautiful OLED edge-to-edge display, the incredible camera quality, wireless charging and water-proof feature. That being said I don’t think this phone was worth the price, much more the iPhone 8 and not significantly better.
Don’t get me wrong, I do love the device, just as much as a love most products apple produces. When it comes to value however, value defined as the worth of something compared to the price paid or asked for it, I am not sure if I consider this item to be of good value. Initially, when I saw the launch event followed by the numerous exhilarating, colorful, dynamic ads I was under the impression that this phone would provide new user experiences using the augmented reality (AR) technology built in to the device.
The camera is just as good, if not better than I expected it to be and I often find myself in a dilemma due to the incredible quality, I no longer need to carry around my professional DSLR camera. Face ID: the new facial biometric scanner in the iPhone X is astonishing. It projects 30,000 invisible dots on your face, mapping the 3D dimensions which creates a high security level, despite some negative criticism the system has gotten. The phones new edge-to-edge OLED display is the most beautiful display I’ve seen on an iPhone, with high ranges of crisp colors and incomparable resolution. I am a sailor so I am at sea a lot, and near bodies of water. Having the iPhone X be waterproof has been a long-awaited feature for me and I really feel more comfortable having that feature. Wireless charging is an emerging technology that is interesting to me, although it isn’t any more convenient than plugging in a cord, or even less convenient in some ways I had to buy the wireless charging pad just due to my interest in new technology. However, I do often find myself plugging in the cord so that I can use the phone while it’s charging.
I am a huge fan of apple and an avid iPhone user, however when it comes to value I just don’t think this phone was worth the $1400 I paid for it and the 12 hours wait in line. There are some features I love such as the great Camera, Face ID, the display and the waterproofing but I expected much more off of the AR capabilities and ‘evolutionary technology’ that this phone was advertised to have. Who knows, maybe this really is a platform for them to build something really great off of, time will tell but in about 8 months the next iPhone will come out and mine will become outdated yet again. Currently, I don’t feel I have gotten the value out of the device that I expected upon buying it."
iphone x,"Worst phone I’ve ever had.olor: SilverSize: 64 GB
You expect for +1000 for it to at least do basic functions like connect to WiFi but can’t even do that. At least once a day the Bluetooth/ WiFi antennae stops working and the phone will crash, you have to turn it completely off. Not to mention all the other problems like the fact that native iPhone apps crash even 9 months after the release. Also noticed it becoming much slower. Needless to say I will no longer be purchasing iPhones."
iphone x,"iPhone X - A Phone From the Future.iPhone X – A phone from the future
Making the jump from the iPhone 7 plus to the iPhone X was a big decision to begin with, how much could change in just one year? Well to the surprise of many (or maybe not) Apple once again crushed this phone. All of the enticing new tricks and treats tucked inside this amazing looking phone was everything Apple users hoped for and more. To review this product all of the following will be taken into account, innovation, battery-life, design, durability, cost, and operating system.

To begin, the ideal user that would buy this phone would be someone with an interest in technological innovation, an overdue upgrade for their current phone, or someone with the desire to just experience what Apple truly stands for, “to design the best personal computers in the world.” One of the only downsides that you may experience with this phone is the price tag. Ringing up at $1,132.00 for the 64 GB and $1,296.96 for the 256 GB may leave a dent in your wallet. Excluding the price tag on this sleek and attractive phone, it is perfect for a user who is constantly checking, or on their device. With the new adaptions to the iPhone X you will now be able to implement the seamless opening and surfing of apps with face recognition as well as fluid finger swipes. Even while boasting these streamlined new tools, the iPhone X also holds a 19.5-hour battery life. Almost double the battery life of the previous iPhone 7. So, if you’re a business man or woman, student, or avid technology guru, you will be pleased with the care and effort put forth into making this phone one of a kind.

Moving on to the design and innovations of the phone. You will now be able to unlock your phone with the most unique thumbprint of all, your face. This allows for easy unlocking, as well, it can be used to make purchases and log onto various apps or websites while surfing the internet. Along with this is the removal of the home button. Though it took a while to get use to this change, overall it was a positive step forward. To get home on your phone now you simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen, quick and easy. Following the patterns of innovation stated above, the new iPhone X carries a dual 12MP sensor array as well as improved aperture and wide angle lens that is supported by image stabilization. This makes for perfect pictures, all the time. Not to mention the video capabilities have improved to include 60p 4k video recording, allowing for some of the best phone recorded videos ever. For the interiors of the phone, Apple has increased the RAM on the phone up to 3GB, allowing the iPhone X to be one of the fastest phones on the market.

When it comes to durability and cost, you may be a touch disappointed, though it must be pointed out. With the front and back of the iPhone X being glass, one drop will lead to a pricy fix (upwards of $700). Though the glass is now better quality and more durable, a drop can lead to serious costs. Some would argue that the price tag on this phone should alleviate some accidental drop costs but with quality comes price. With the potential for a costly drop, you are able to buy a case along with newly designed durable screen cover that can save you from the $700 down the road.

In conclusion, this is the best phone you would be able to purchase at this time when considering reliability, innovation, and usability. Apple once again did a fantastic job designing this phone and if you’re on the fence about the purchase there are many options to upgrade or a 2-year payment plan with built in AppleCare. Overall this could be the phone that changes your perception of what a phone is and what a phone can do."
iphone x,iPhone X Defect.My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I don’t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I’ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn’t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it’s a Saturday and he’s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn’t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that’s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it’s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I’ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I’ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I’ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I’d have to say I’m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple. Hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th. To be continued...
iphone x,OVERPRICE. overprice.... more expensive than the new Iphone.. crazy
iphone x,"Irreplaceable fragile glass back unacceptable. Not a fan of the fragile glass back which costs 550 dollars and a complete disassembly/chassis replacement to fix. That is a massive design failure by making something that should be user replaceable such as the iPhone 4s back. Now I’m left with a shattered phone which can’t be fixed. It’s a good thing I have a phone case to stop me from cutting my hands, otherwise it would be a safety hazard. FYI, this happened with my case on. If you choose to have Apple fix this issue they will be replacing the entire phone which is environmentally irresponsible and greedy by pocketing 160 of that 550 you paid.

Besides that this is a solid phone comparatively, I do like the stainless steel frame over their aluminum from the past but wish that I could omit wireless charging and have the stainless steel material throughout."
iphone x,"iphone X - Too many cons for me,  have had the x for sometime now. I can say that of all the iphones, the x is my biggest disappointment. I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc. This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off. I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue. Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues. Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects??? It's more than that. I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy. The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan. The face recognition is awful. I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern. If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off. A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it. These are all legit concerns. Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done. I am truly disappointed. I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine. The x by far being the most complaints with hardware issues. Save your money and get the 8 or maybe try another brand but do not waste your money on the x."
iphone x,One Star. did not work as planned it was a fraud
iphone x,Great but go to these places to get cheaper.

It's very awesome."
iphone x,Quality Problems with the iPhone X.just bought an iPhone X for my son in college to replace his iPhone 7+. He called us tonight but the speakerphone quality was horrible. He could hear us fine but it sounded like he was underwater (it was too difficult to understand him so we hung up early). I am quite sure it was not a signal issue as we speak with him every Sunday from his apartment with good signal (AT&T). My advice is to take your time ordering in case it is a hardware defect that cannot be solved by a software update. Hopefully it is the latter given what I paid for it.
iphone x,Own the future of smartphones NOW. Upgraded from an iPhone 8 Plus. Must say it took some time getting used to the X but I love it. FaceID has worked well over 80 % of the time for me. The OLED screen is beautiful. The notch is not noticeable after you get used to it and distinguishes the iPhone.
iphone x,... wait to be apart of history by owning this GREAT phone! I cant wait to be apart of history by owning this GREAT phone!

iphone x,Three Stars.Great product but beware you will pay the Taxes if you ship it overseas.
iphone x,"Best iPhone ever.Apple did a great job with this phone. The screen is amazing and astonishing. How it covers the whole front of the phone and the quality of colors is just amazing.
I does take a while to get accustomed to the new gestures like going to home, and switching apps, and specially unlocking the phone if you've been using TouchID for several years, but it's worth it.
I love FaceID because it's incredibly accurate, natural, and fast. It gives the impression that your phone has no access code because it's so fast to unlock it, but you can rest assured that it really is protected, and nobody can access it.
And of course the OS is great. Apple's iOS is very easy to use, very powerful, and user friendly.

iPhone 7 Plus,"I HAVE TO TOUCH THE HOME BUTTON W/BARE HANDS

This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone. No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves. None of them work with my phone. So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind. Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold! I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone.

SOLUTION

I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:

Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on.

This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot. Then to unlock your iPhone 7:

1. Press the sleep button on the right of the phone.
2. Press the Assistive Touch dot.
3. Touch the home button.
4. Enter your SIX digit pass code.

Okay, so now I feel better, but I still want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into ALL THE EXTRA STEPS each time you want to open the phone.

OTHER CONS

1. I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard. It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5. Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen. I have tried it on every sensitivity level.
2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works. Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over.

I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects."
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. I love it!! Totally worth it.

iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good
iPhone 7 Plus,"I had a horrible experience with receiving this item on time. I had a horrible experience with receiving this item on time. Secondly, after it arrived, I noticed it was missing a needle like stuff that is supposed to be used to open the SIM card slot"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Who needs headphones? The sound of music was never better from a ""speaker phone."" I know conventional wisdom says start with the carrier and strike your bargain from there. But I knew it would have to be an iPhone, and my wife, moreover, insisted I accompany her to the Apple Store for my birthday gift--any Apple phone I chose.

I went in with every intention to to get an iPhone 6S, since the lack of a headphone jack strikes me as impractical if not preposterous. After auditioning 5-6 models, I left the store with the iPhone 7 Plus. The decision was simple--based primarily on one single criterion: the quality of the SOUND of MUSiC played back from the onboard speakers.

The sales clerk suggested I not dismiss the 7 too quickly on the basis of the headphone jack omission. First, the phone comes with an adapter that can be placed over your headphone pin and plugged into the charging port (that helps, especially given the collection of headphones I've acquired). More importantly, the iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone with: 1. stereo (2) speakers; 2. pretty good (for a phone) speakers.

The clerk then fired up a busy superhero movie score on the 4-5 iPhones I was considering. Not helpful. The clerk suggested pulling up any tune I wished through the store's Apple Music Subscription. I went with Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" which begins with Bill Evans rubato piano, then goes into tempo with Paul Chambers' acoustic bass (on ""So What"") in a call-response exchange between bass and ensemble.

Using the iPhone 6s, with a single speaker, the bass was all but absent (the store was quite noisy). Moving to the iPhone7 Plus, Chambers' bass walked right out of the phone speakers and into my ear, each pitch identifiable along with string ""buzz"" and extra-musical ""fingering"" noise. Suddenly the question of the headphone jack was rendered meaningless. The combination of stereo sound plus slightly more powerful, larger speakers was all I would need to get maximum value from the phone.

I'm a hobbyist musician (piano), and I no longer practice with a notated score. All I require is a player (and a piano) to learn a tune, and a device like the iPhone 7 Plus makes learning new tunes easier than ever.

I'm also a photographer of sorts, and the wider lens for unprecedented clarity shooting with available light as well as a feature permitting razor-sharp focus on a subject in the foreground and blurred-out focus on figures in the immediate background struck me as more than a novelty. With my 35mm film cameras (Pentax Spotmatics), I'd have to switch to an expensive, long and heavy zoom lens to achieve the same effect.

I've read that Apple may be planning on a blockbuster iPhone 8 with an OLED (curved) screen. I think I can leave the curves to Marilyn Monroe or a Cinerama production.. The 7Plus should last me and, though it's a tad big and cumbersome as a phone, it should be harder to misplace and/or lose than the previous half a dozen ""candy-bar phones"" were. (I don't need more than 1GB for using the phone, but 128GB is enough to carry a generous supply of music tracks and space for making videos).

Only problems: finding the best carrier for the least money and unloading three barely used cell phones (2 Jitterbugs and a Spark Aquos Crystal--good screen but artificially ""enhanced"" sound and barely accessible controls, if you can find them)."
iPhone 7 Plus,"It is the best iPhone you can get. As for the best smartphone… well that’s for you to decide.The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus at first glance don’t look all too different from their predecessors. In fact they are physically identical except for: The home button on the front, the camera in the back, and of course the missing headphone jack at the bottom. The new iPhones are IP67 dust and water resistant so they can take a splash or accidental drops in the toilet which I won't demonstrate and will take Apples word for it!

Other than that, everything else is practically the same. The basic design scheme, layout of the buttons, and the screen sizes are still 4.7 and 5.5 inches. Anyone looking for a complete redesign, well maybe next year. Sure we get black and Jet Black colors but that's not as big a deal as apple made it to be on their key note.

I decided to go with the matte black, or just simply the black color because I like black phones, and the Jet Black looked like it could scratch and smudge way too easily.

There is a welcome change in the weight. This year's iPhones are slightly lighter than the previous generations and they house a higher capacity battery that will give you an extra hour on both devices.

Now the big differences from the 6S and 7 are almost all internal. The iPhone 7 and 7 plus new feature the new A10 chip which is of course much faster than its predecessor. There's also more RAM added, the 7 has 2GB and the Plus has 3GB. the smaller sized iPhone now comes equipped with OIS in the camera so that's no longer a unique Plus feature.

What makes the Plus unique however is the extra 55mm camera for 2X optical zoom and bokeh effects. Which we will get into later.

How well does the new home button work? Well it was weird at first. When I tried it out at the apple store when these were on display, I hated it. The force touch effect was nowhere near as real as the force touch on the MacBooks which feels like an actual click. However after a few days use, I got used to it and it.

As for the missing headphone jack, this omission obviously didn’t make any sense and Apple’s courage explanation still remains one of the greatest mysteries of life. There was no real benefit to the device in removing it and adds a minor inconvenience having to carry an extra dongle.

As it turns out… it isn’t so bad. My solution is to leave that dongle on your favorite pair of headphones… or if you’ve already switched to bluetooth, then it doesn’t really matter. However, times when you want to top of your battery while listening to your music especially in a flight, you’’re either s*** out of luck or you need to invest in another adapter that supports both lightning and the headphone jack creating more first world problems!

Battery Life on the iPhone 7 Plus is on the above average side and you can pretty much get all day use out of this. I usually have my phone unplugged in the morning, use it for work, make calls, send emails, social media stuff, watch netflix while working out, and then by 9:30PM, I have 32% battery left.

As for the camera, just like every year it gets better every time. Now how much better is the question. As Phil Schiller mentioned in the iPhone Keynote, the smartphone or in this case the iPhone is the best and only camera most people will ever own. The 12 megapixel camera on the iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t disappoint, it launches fast, focuses quickly and takes great photos.

On the Plus, you get that extra 55mm lens that gives you the 2X optical zoom as well as giving you the depth effect (or bokeh) after the recent 10.1 iOS update. Front facing camera has been upgraded from 5MP to 7MP so you can now take even better selfies.

Another nice addition to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the inclusion of stereo speakers. It’s a little weird how this is set up but it sort of makes sense. You have one speaker located at the earpiece, and another located at the usual spit at the bottom of the phone. They can’t replace high quality stereo speakers but they sound decent enough.

Performance on the iPhone 7 is just incredible. It is faster than any smartphone out there, which is the trade off of Apple's tight grip on the software and navigating through the UI, launching apps, and running them is where the iPhone shines. Sure you get a few hiccups on some third party apps but they are almost always constantly updated.

I'd do a comparison with other phones but again, I turned in my fire hazard note 7 and am waiting for the google pixel. We will just have to wait and see how the pixel or 821 based devices compete against the iPhone.

But is it significantly faster than the iPhone 6S? In real world usage, you will probably have a hard time finding the difference. However, if you are coming from an iPhone 6 or older, then I would totally recommend the upgrade.

And to state the obvious, it is the best iPhone you can get. As for the best smartphone… well that’s for you to decide."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Love it and I am an actual user that is moving from the Galaxy S7 Edge. Not going to do a crazy long review. Just wanted to touch on some things. First off, the phone is just great (I am not focusing on some stupid cost of part BS someone else did, but rather actual use). I still have the S7 Edge but will be selling it. The battery life on the Edge was not that great to me and I tried everything to get it to be better. The iPhone 7 Plus battery life has been so much better. My S7 was usually at 62% when I got home for lunch where as my iPhone 7 Plus is at 87% (same usage..well maybe a little more for the iPhone 7 since it is still fairly new to me). This is roughly 6 hours of being off the charger and I use it at work a lot for pictures, slo-mo video of equipment and exchange email/texting.
The speed of the iPhone 7 Plus is also top notch. Considerably faster than my S7 Edge and also my friends iPhone 6 (not 6S). The camera or dual cameras work great as did the Galaxy S7 edge. I do like the 4K video better on the iPhone 7 though and the few low light shots I took were amazingly good.
So what about the headphone jack (or lack there of). This was something I was worried about at first. I have a very nice set of quad driver headphones that I use daily at the track. I wasn't about to invest in another set of headphones and give these up. When I found out they were including the adapter I said ""What the hell..I will give it a try"". The adapter is very flexible which is a good thing. The connection to the lightning port is solid and using it with my headphones was no issue at all. Actually I don't know this for a fact, but I questioned whether that port is supplying more power to them. Quad drivers need decent power (for the most part) to get sound volume and good quality. The S7 Edge sucked for this. The iPhone 7 Plus allowed me the highest volume yet and the audio quality at that high volume was right on. Again, I don't know if the phone is just pushing more power to them, but it is distinctly better.
I am not going to go on and on about this phone, but pretty much all other items. The new home button, pressure sensitive screen (although I know this isn't the first iPhone to have that), stereo speakers etc are just done extremely well.
The OS? Well I was a super moderator in an Android forum and know all the arguments both ways. I will say that the integration with all apps on iOS is just much more fluid. Sure, you do have some limitations, but when it works so well, why does that really matter?
I do have to ask some iPhone regulars. Has Apple made a lot of changes to their keyboard over the past couple of years? I just find the typing on this phone to be extremely accurate and it just feels right. As a matter of fact, I just went to take the proof picture and typed on the Edge for the first time since getting the iPhone. Not fun at all!!!

Call me a Apple Sheep or whatever you want, but I assure you I am not a die hard of any system. The iPhone 7 Plus combined with iOS 10 is just plain out superior to anything else out there!! IMHO

For the record I have the iPhone 7 Plus 128GB in Black (not jet black). I also have the Apple leather cover on it which works very well.

On a side note....iOS 10 messaging is a fricken blast!!! If you just installed iOS 10 and have not watched a Youtube video to learn all the new features you need to do it. And...if you own an older iPhone and you are not able to long press on the send arrow to get to more features, go to settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Make sure Reduce motion is set to OFF. Then you will be able to get to things like invisible ink, fireworks, etc.

Pictures are only to prove I own both. Not meant to show what anything looks like since they are low grade photos.

Enjoy"
iPhone 7 Plus,"The Incredible 7.I’ve been an iPhone user for years now and I’ve had the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6s. Currently, I am a user of the iPhone 7 plus. Now that I own an iPhone 7 plus and have adjusted to using it, I can speak on both the advantages and disadvantages that come with the phone. For instance, Apple decided to add a double camera which I think is a good enhancement because it helps to improve the quality of the pictures that I take. I often take pictures of myself, my friends and events that I am a part of. A good quality picture can help to preserve good memories. For example, taking pictures at Thanksgiving and Christmas with all the family around the table and the children playing. Looking back at the pictures from these events makes you feel like you’re back in that very moment you took the picture. One of the features Apple decided to remove was having a jack for the headphones. Instead they replaced the headphone jack with another speaker. That is a upside to not having a plug for the headphones now, because now the phone is louder. However, I can not listen to music in my headphones and charge my phone at the same time which can sometimes be an inconvenience. In comparison to the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 has better and more advanced features. If you are a person who is constantly using their phone and likes to have all the newest techno devices, I would recommend this phone 100%. Overall I believe that the phone has made many well thought out decisions, regardless of the sacrifices that had to be made."
iPhone 7 Plus,Box with no phone. I purchased the phone as a gift and when my boyfriend opened the box the phone wasn't in there.I'm really disappointed because it was really expensive.
iPhone 7 Plus,"I love my iPhone 7 Plus. I love my iPhone 7 Plus. Here is a breakdown of my favs and not so favs, and I'm not gonna go into crazy details just major things from a buyer's perspective.

FAVS
Battery. This is one of the best things on this not so little device! I love it that I don't have to worry about charging it through the day. I leave it charging at night and I don't need to charge it again until I get home from work (and I have to say I still have battery left at night around 60 or 50% that's a lot!) and also keep in mind that the Plus has a bigger battery than the regular 7.

Design: The design is just beautiful. I got the Jet Black and I was worried it was going to be hard to maintained as I have read about the fingerprints, scratches, etc. But let me tell you is not bad at all and I do have OCD when it comes to my devices. Would I choose the same design again? Hell yeah it looks very cool and beautiful, if you are debating about the Jet Black or the regular Black go for the Jet.

Screen, quality and speed: Spectacular! I love the vivid colors perfect for playing games or watching movies! Speed is amazing once you lay your thumb on the home button it unlocks your phone in a second! very impressive.

Not my cup of tea:
Bezels: I really wish that they made the bezels smaller, it is a large phone so I wished they Apple would've thought better about making it more manageable. It is uncomfortable to have on your back pocket so you might have to get used to having it on your front pocket. Not a big deal for me but it might be a big turn off for others.

No headphone jack: I'm still trying to get used to this! My biggest disappointment is that I sometimes forget to bring my adapter with me when I'm traveling and I find myself having to listen to the radio because my phone no longer has a regular headphone jack. (I recently purchase the wireless beats and would be reviewing it shortly)

Random crashes: This might just be my iPhone but once in a while (maybe once or twice a month) my iPhone will freeze and it won't let me do anything for a few seconds. I will be bringing it to the store soon and I will be updating my review, hopefully is just mine.

Overall the screen, the battery, the design, iOS itself and the camera would make me buy this iPhone over again. From my personal opinion there are way more pros than cons for me to go with this beast!

I really hope this review helps you decide!"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Is it a substitute foe health insurance? No, but it could be a good prophylactic. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Congressman, was quoted this morning as follows: ""Buy health insurance, not a new iPhone!"" Strange, esp. from a Republican and under our new President, who's first priority is running the country like a prosperous business. If a choice is to be made, at least make it between health insurance and that Korean phone--hot an Apple iPhone! Actually, had planned on the iPhone 6S--the size and the headphone jack were both ""clinchers"" (I've got dozens of highly prized earphones). But then I went to the Apple Store and tried them all--6s and 7's (the latter at the salesman's insistence).

I saw nothing about the 7 to dissuade me from my original plan--that is, until the agent pointed lout a couple of details about the ""sound"" coming from the speakers ONLY on the 7Plus. Not only is it the only iPhone in stereo but the speakers are good enough to pump out sufficient bass to be a real practical use to a musician who listens and learns much music by ear (my reading days are go). I quickly dispensed with the demo tracks--superhero and cartoon features with orchestra arrangements and pizzazz. Tells me nothing.

But upon going to the most successful jazz album of all time--Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue""--I was able to verify the accuracy of the speakers at reproducing the most complex sound of all--the acoustic piano (the Steinway played by Bill Evans in the Columbia studio). More importantly, I could quickly identify the pitches of Paul Chambers' acoustic bass, which opens the first track: ""So What.""

That did it. A brainless decision--and a couple hundred more than I'd intended to spend. I hope its size will make it more difficult to lose. Also, I plan to make use of the ""portrait feature"" unique to this Apple phone (sharpens the person in the foreground while blurring out the background, for a shot free of distractions from the subject.

And of course it was good to know that headphones can be plugged into the power jack of the phone through the use of an adapter. But when I sit at the piano, I'd frankly rather dispense with putting the phone in and out of my ears. The onboard speakers are a big ""plus""--in fact, the deal maker, in my case. In short, this phone is more apt to keep me more healthy than another aircraft carrier."
iPhone 7 Plus,"his actually came with wired headphones. How cynical was that? I purchased this phone through AT&T to take advantage of several deals they were offering, and yes it does require me going out into my yard to shovel off the direct dish. Not that I actually would. My husband has fallen for that one before. (That deal is cousin to ""I will clean up after my puppy."") Currently not being in global warming has been very helpful on this February 60 degree day in Michigan.

I have always used an android phone, Notes 1, 2, 3, & 4, because of work and house networking issues. It always seemed like it was a good idea to keep one android phone in use.

The downside to having an android phone is that I ended up carrying three devices most of the time. Even with the size of a Note, I still had my tablet when I needed to be able to go online and work on different things. Then I carried my iTouch to listen to music and books. Of course, I could have put those on my android, but sound quality, through any Apple device, is better.

So I said to myself, ""Self, why are you carrying THREE devices around?"" We won't go into the entire conversation, but suffice it to say, I started looking for an iPhone. I did the research and I knew the problem.

The most serious, egregious, and unforgivable problem with this phone is that it can not be wired to headphones. No headphones attach. They have to be blue tooth.

For those of us who have invested a lot in headphones FOR sound quality, this is a disaster. It is ridiculous. Sure, I have bluetooth. FOR THE GYM. Where I can barely hear anything anyway.

And one way to tell Apple was out of control was that they included wired headphones. Where do they think I am going to put those?"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Five stars. I didn't purchase my 7 Plus through Amazon. With that being said if you choose to do so make sure it is SOLD BY AMAZON. Many reviews state it was opened or its a ""Korean"" model. You will possibly be tossing away $1,100 if you purchase outside of Amazon on their site.
The 7 Plus itself is faster with a better camera than my 6S Plus and I spent the extra $100 for the 256 GB model compared to the 128 GB. But if you have a 6S Plus and can wait for the iPhone 8, do it.
Additionally, there is a disclaimer from Apple on the Jet Black model only. It states the Jet Black color (only) is extremely susceptible to scratches due to the coating process used. I can verify it will scratch even when wiped with a micro fiber cloth. It's a beautiful color/shade but what good is it if it must be covered up to protect it?"
iPhone 7 Plus,"256GB iPhone 7 Plus in Rose Gold. The advantages are the dual camera that has a 12 megapixels with 7 megapixels for the second camera with DSLR quality, which enhances the colors and quality, has 2x the optical zoom and records 4k videos. It has the A10 fusion processor which enhances its performance and balances the battery consumption. The retina HD display with 3D touch that allows users to press the pressure sensitive display that allows you to access shortcuts faster. Water resistant of IP67, meaning up to 1 meter. The storage size of 32 GB, 128 GB, or 256GB.
The disadvantages are not having a headphone jack. You would have the use the lightning connector/adapter or buy wireless headphones. The price is outrageous.
Personally, my whole family is on team iPhone. The iPhone is great because I had a major upgrade (from the 5S). It is better than any previous iPhone models."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Mine is a Verizon one with same specs. No headphone jack big design flaw on great device. I got this phone after my iPhone 6 Plus can't touch disease. Very impressed with the iPhone 7 and I love the red. Part of the proceeds go to HIV support. One thing I'm quite surprised by his the very clear design flaw , there is no headphone jack . Where we are used to having a speaker on the bottom on one side and a headphone jack on the other side, Now there are two speakers. This means stereo speakers at the bottom and then only the lightning power port in the center. It comes with the same headphones you get with the six and five, only now they won't plug in normally to the bottom of your phone without a little lightening adapter which Apple supplies in the 7 box. The problem is you won't be able to charge your phone battery and listen with your headphones at the same time. You can only do one or the other. I don't know of this was their way of forcing you into buying a $75 cordless headphones but no matter what the intention, this was a mistake. And a great inconvenience for most of us . Has 1 million things and is such a phenomenal device otherwise."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Not worth it. Getting to saying goodbye. There are some very detailed excellent reviews of this phone already. I think the simple truth now is that Apple is not spending the time and money to be cutting edge anymore. Their price relies on the eco-system of iPad, Macbook, iPhone. The weakness in this scheme is that when these other components of the eco-system start failing (such as the Macbook Air quality/reliabilitycharging problems, then at some point it becomes less hassle to buy products at half (or much less than half) and replace them if they have problems. A Kindle Fire for 79 dollars is more easily replaced than a $750 iPad. Apple has become far too greedy. First they maximized what they take out of your pocket, now they go to the next phase of profit maximization, minimizing what they put into your pocket."
iPhone 7 Plus,"iPhone 7 Plus Jet Black 128gb. I have upgraded from an iPhone 6 plus to a iPhone 7 plus with hesitation. I was very happy with the 6 plus and was considering sticking it out for the iPhone 7S plus to be released. I mean, Apple introduced another phone that looked pretty much like the past two releases and I did not like that they took the ear jack out. However, the water resistance sold me. This was something that I felt would keep my phone safe when using outside in the elements. I also was very excited about the camera was getting rave reviews. So I counted the pennies and did the plunge. I opted on the Pre-Order with US Cellular picking the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb. As everyone knows, the Jet Black was a back order nightmare and I waited 4 weeks for it to arrival. I picked Jet Black though because it was a different look for Apple that I thought would appease my desire in change. I was warned up front about the coating being easily scratched so I had a case waiting for it when it arrived. Three days ago, it finally arrived! I immediately placed it in the case to keep the scuffs off the finish. But I have to confess that I have removed the case a few times just to admire the finish – It is gorgeiPhone 7 Plus Jet Black 128gbous!!! The black finish has such an appeal to me that suggests elegance. Now let’s talk nuts and bolts. The processor is zippy! I could see a difference from the get-go on the speed of opening apps and doing functions on the 7. I never considered the 6 plus a snail but in comparison….. I’d take the 7 any day! The camera is dynamic! I have found it so flexible to move from up close to far distant shots. Really nice far distant shots! The 6 plus had a decent camera but the zoom on the 7 is a whole new league. I really like the live picture feature on the camera as well. For those who have not experienced it, You snap a photo and it records a mini video of the second before the shot, second during the shot, and a second after the shot. So you can see the action leading up to the photo you had taken. This is done by pressing on the photo while viewing it. Its good for those viewing the photo to have another understanding what was going on when the photo was taken. Another improvement is the voice mail to text. Say you are in a meeting and a notification pops up that you have a voice mail. It would be disruptive to check the voice mail to hear the message left. With the 7, it prints the voice mail out under the play button. This is not merely a iPhone 7 improvement but can only be done on the 6, 6s and 7. Nice! So All in all, I am very happy with the iPhone 7 plus. I highly recommend the phone and can’t wait to see what the 7s Plus has to offer.
"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Avoid! Doesn't work as a phone! Even after warranty replacement. The device is cool but it doesn't work as a phone. A warranty replacement did not resolve anything. I never experienced anything like this with my previous iPhones. I often have to answer calls up to 5 times before someone can hear me and the cell service drops out sporadically.

The Bluetooth is totally broken, cuts in and out with the hands-free in my car, defeating the point of hands-free. Bluetooth music connections are choppy and also disconnects every 10-30 minutes. Other people online complain about this same phenomenon.

I'm seriously considering selling it and buying a 6S but I wouldn't feel right selling a fundamentally flawed product to someone else. Again, replacing it with a new one at the Apple store from a newer production batch fixed none of these problems. I tried resetting everything and set up the replacement as a new phone just in case there was something wrong in my backup, but the problems persist."
iPhone 7 Plus,"The purpose of the IPhone is to have an easy and affective technology that is very easy to have. A. Introduction:
i. The product that I will be reviewing is IPhone 7 plus. My entire family have always been using the IPhone, we always upgrade every time there is a new phone that comes out. The first time that I got an IPhone was in my 9th grade and I would would not want to change to another phone company. The purpose of the IPhone is to have an easy and affective technology that is very easy to have accesses to.
B. The main strengths of the product are fast, strong, and affective
i. The IPhone has a lot of strength, one of my favorite things about the IPhone is how fast the phone it self is. Whenever I am out of the house without Wi-Fi, I always have internet on my phone.
ii. Another strength that I like about the phone is how strong it is. I had the same phone for almost a year now and it has been working very good so far. For example, that past phones that I had they would break or just not turn on but the IPhone worked with me really good.
iii. The IPhone is affective because it can almost do anything you want it to do. For example, whenever I can’t use the phone with my hands I have Siri to do it for me.
C. The main weakness of the product is battery, headphones, and apps.
i. The IPhone battery is one of the weakness that I dislike because I use my phone for a variety of stuff and I can take 2 hours to drain all of my battery.
ii. Another weakness that I think the IPhone has is their headphones. For the IPhone 7 there isn’t a charger cord and a headphones cord, so you cant do both at the same time.
iii. Some of Apps are not supported in the software that the apple company doesn’t not allow.
D. Overall Evaluation
i. Overall this is the best phone I believe if you want a strong and fast phone."
iPhone 7 Plus,Great iphone 7plus. Like the color the camera is great all out it feel good in my hand it look just like a iPhone from the store has lot of gb so I can download apps
iPhone 7 Plus,"Best phone I have ever had! iPhone 7 Review
This past Christmas my parents bought me the new iPhone 7. Since the day I got the gift I have been in love with my new phone. The model that my parents got for me is matte black 16GB basically your standard new iPhone. I have had a handful of iPhones in the past and this one is by far the best one I have had and let me explain why.
The most important reason why I love this phone so much is just the fact that works and it works really fast. Out of all the iPhones I have had this one hands down has the fastest loading and processing speed. Along with the excellent speed of the phone it also is easy to operate making this phone capable of being used by just about every one. Another great aspect about the phone is I have yet to experience any bug problems or glitches with the phone. This is something that I am thrilled about since my last two iPhone six’s both had some bug issues so I am hopeful these problems have been worked out of the phone.
Not only has Apple make this faster and easier to operate then all the other phones they have made. They have also made it some handy improvements to the new phone. The first one that will make any customer happy is that the phone is now water resistant. This is a huge improvement because now you don’t have to worry about anymore water damage. However, I would highly recommend using a phone case just to avoid the cracking of the screen from a dropping it. The second major improvement I use almost everyday is the camera. Apple clearly did some major work on the phone’s camera because you can now shoot 4K videos that produces just mind blowing videos with crystal clear quality. The last major improvement I have noticed from the six to the seven is the fingerprint scanner. This allows you enter your phone, download apps, and even pay for something just by putting your finger on the home button. The new fingerprint scanner on the seven is a lot faster at reading the fingerprint and more accurate. I personally remember on the six for it sometimes to take up to five times for the phone to read my finger before letting me in.
I believe the iPhone seven is a game changer in the phone world that can be used by just about everyone. They offer two different sizes of the phone two to fit everyone's needs. If you are not just an average phone user like me they offer different sizes of memory too."
iPhone 7 Plus,"One Star. Horrible internet speed...perfect in every other way but internet speed is too slow. I'd give it a 0 if possible, I'm going back to my iphone 4. This is the worst piece of crap crap has ever seen and crap has eyes......eyes next to the chicken. chicken"
iPhone 7 Plus,"I ordered this product and it was packaged horribly, when i opened the package. I ordered this product and it was packaged horribly, when i opened the package, the phone didn't even turn on. I tried to charge it but it just kept shutting on and off even though it was on 100%. The only good thing about my package was that it came with a charger bt the rest i give a 1/10. Im insanely disappointed. This was a waste of $850."
iPhone 7 Plus,"
2.0 out of 5 stars... it never broken a screen ever and take really good care of phone just a crap screen there where ... Apple made a phone to break this time I had it 2 days and screen broke and I took into apple and they want $130 to fix it never broken a screen ever and take really good care of phone just a crap screen there where 2 other people in there for screen replacement as well so beware"
iPhone 7 Plus,"The fastest phone money can buy. Switched from the Note 7 to the iPhone 7 plus and I'm so happy that I did. I'm loving using iOS and the camera is definitely better than my Note 7 was. The addition to iPhones of water and dust resistance are huge for me and the main reason I never tried an iPhone before, IP67 is almost a necessity for my lifestyle and my job. Also the build quality and design of this phone is just beautiful. It may not be bezelless like my Note was but it's a better looking and better feeling device. Button placement for the sleep/wake button could've been abit lower is my only complaint. Switching from Android to iOS is huge change and I like things from both. You can't beat the customizability of Android but iOS is faster and seemly more intuitive and well thought out. Also iOS is much ""cleaner"" looking and the keyboard and touch screen I find better. Jumping from 1440p to 1080p is literally not noticeable because the colors and sharpness of the iPhone 7 plus are much better. I actually prefer this screen over my notes and I really didn't expect that. I do miss the spen and the headphone jack but I've been wanting to switch to using Bluetooth headphones at home as well as work so now I'll buy a pair for use around the house. Overall the iPhone 7 plus is an amazing and beautiful device that surely isn't a huge change from its predecessors but a wonderful refinement. The addition of IP67 water and dust resistant and the major improvement of the camera to put it on par with if not THE best camera right now. Only the pixel xl and Note 7 are competing. The increase in performance with the A10 fusion chip also makes this by far the fastest device I've ever used, I have yet to experience any lag. If you want the FASTEST phone you can't get one faster than the large storage iPhone 7 and 7 plus. (Reports have shown that the 128gb and 256gb models are much faster than the 32gb models due to technicality of current storage manufacturing). I can't recommend the iPhone 7 plus more and that is coming from a top tier android device and using android for the past 4 years. Solid job here Apple, for me this is a perfect device."
iPhone 7 Plus,"I like this product would like to have a sample. I like this product would like to have a sample,Because christmas is coming up I would like to get on to give to grand kid, thank you."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Worst iPhone ever! iPhone 7 Plus is the worst iPhone ever!!! While the larger screen is nice. The health app is completely off. Apps tend to freeze and rebooting seldom helps. I don't notice any better battery life that they claim. I've been an iPhone owner since the first one, but this one is the worse one."
iPhone 7 Plus,Apple is awful. If I could give massive negative reviews on Apple products I would. They suck badly. User friendly went right out the window. iPhone 7s is the worst phone I have ever owned.
iPhone 7 Plus,"Five stars. It's exactly what's it's advertise as.

The phone was new unused, was able to put Apple care onto it. Shipped fast, and worked right of the box. Onkky con is it came with a European style plus not a big issue just something expect."
iPhone 7 Plus,One Star. $847 from Apple store(with tax)
iPhone 7 Plus,DO NOT BUY!! The phone lags and heats up for no reason.... I dont think the phone is smart enough to handle the fastest processor on the market! Sorry and it's waaayy too overpriced..... If I'm going g to pay this much I might as well purchase the Pixel Xl
iPhone 7 Plus,One Star. No go
iPhone 7 Plus,"LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!! I love this phone it looks GREAT but it also works very well. I did not by it on this account but I would get this phone instead of the 8 plus. This phone is like Cadillac of phones and the camera on the back makes it look so cool. I bought 3 to give for birthday presents and they loved them. My friend has a Samsung and my phone beat the camera"
iPhone 7 Plus,How 128gb help you. All perform screen the 128gb is great if you like take pictures or download a lot of games
iPhone 7 Plus,"not all phones here support GSM and CDMA. phone from Applehome only supports GSM brand. But article online says ""unlocked models support both CDMA and GSM bands"". This was not clear until purchase. Be careful."
iPhone 7 Plus,"
1.0 out of 5 starsThe phone is normally brand new, nothing special. ...The phone is normally brand new, nothing special. But I have required for orginal receipt twice, and seller can't even provide any proof of the purchase of this iPhone."
iPhone 7 Plus,"Best Phone To Date! I bought this phone from T-Mobile. It's impressive. Great camera, good battery life, speed's incredible. Highly recommended!"
iPhone 7 Plus,Three Stars.

iPhone 7 Plus,One Star. iphone 7 can not find 128GB and red color.
iPhone 7 Plus,Great iPhone ! I've purchased this phone to help the seller sell these . You all should support the sellers product . This is a great product to consider buying !
iPhone 7 Plus,Love this phone. This is a great phone.
iPhone 7 Plus,"Improvements over the iPhone 6+!! The iPhone 7 Plus offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S Plus. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note.

- Better display (wider colour gamut)
- Better taptic engine
- 4 grams lighter
- IP67 Water and dust resistance
- Way better A10 Fusion CPU
- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p)
- Rear wide angle lens have OIS, telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS. Bummer!
- Better low light performance
- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE
- Slightly better battery life
- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)

The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S plus after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note.

The telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS which is disappointing. Images taken on the sensor usually underperforms, especially in low light conditions due to its smaller aperture size. Pictures taken on the telephoto lens is also usually slightly blurred.

People also reported on the hissing issues on the 7 Plus model specifically that can be captured when recording video/audio when the CPU/GPU is under load. Not all phones have this problem and for me, I just can hear a slight humming sound coming from the phone.

Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!"
iPhone 7 Plus,I want to try a sample. I will love a sample I want to try it out to let the world know how it works
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Best phone I have had
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars.Very good phone
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Totally love this product
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Everything was good!
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Love it
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good
iPhone 7 Plus,Four Stars. I loved this phone even though i didn't buy it
iPhone 7 Plus,"Disappointing. Slow. Worse reception than the 6. AT&T says the iPhone 7 can't handle multiple apps running at the same time or else it will switch to 4G instead of their LTE network. So compared to my iPhone 6, I have to now keep closing out all the other apps that may be running in order to get the one I'm using currently to work correctly. I haven't actually tried this....but we'll see. I'm leaning towards them not really knowing what they're talking about.

Apple claims the battery lasts much better. I'm not sure I can notice a difference between the 6 and the 7 in the longevity of the battery. I guess I can only say I'm happy it didn't get worse.

The processor seems slow. I was looking forward to these fast speeds that eliminating the headphone port was supposed to alllow. Again, I don't seem to notice any improvement over the 6. In fact I almost feel like my 6 is faster than the 7.

At the moment, I'm a little underwhelmed by my the new phone. It looks the same..but performs worse. I only upgraded because AT&T had a promotion that got me a free phone if I exchanged my 6 for it.

I got in a pool with my iPhone 6..hopefully the 7 will prevent me from killing my phone that way again."
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Nice fast speed heat proof.
iPhone 7 Plus,One Star. expensive
iPhone 7 Plus,"Five stars, happy customer. love this iPhone. I has Samsung galaxy phone and just upgraded to iphone 7 plus. Apple iphone is much better than the Samsung galaxy phones in terms of quality and design. I'm satisfied with my order and would definitely recommend iphone 7 plus.
"
iPhone 7 Plus,"The model information is false. In the order details ... The model information is false. In the order details it claims to be model A1778, but after having problems with the phone we took it to an Apple store and it is not the same model. This meant they couldn't work on the phone in any way because there was no proof it was legitimately purchased. Even after showing the Amazon order details this wasn't enough confirmation that the phone wasn't stolen because of the conflicting information, they couldn't tell us the actual model number for this reason. I have requested the correct model number information from PureMobile and am awaiting a response."
iPhone 7 Plus,"INTERNATIONAL VERSION NOT US VERSION. LISTING LIES. So, first and foremost, this listing title is a lie. This is NOT a US version unlocked iPhone 7 plus 256gb. It is an international version Iphone 7 plus 256gb. That means it cannot be used on any CDMA networks in the US such as Verizon or sprint. I know this because I tried to activated this phone on both these carriers. This phone can be activated on GSM networks such as AT&T or T-Mobile. But do not expect to be able to activate this phone in sprint, Verizon, or US cellular. I wasted 2 hours of my day going from store to store trying to activated this phone on sprint or Verizon. Furthermore, the shipping carrier left my $1000 iPhone in my open garage for everyone to see. When I got the text notification that my package was delivered, I went downstairs to check the mail. I opened the door to my garage and saw a group of individuals lurking around garage entrance where the shipping carrier left the package. When they saw me they ran straight to the street. Had I not been home to go get my package, these kids would have stolen by package left OUT IN THE OPEN by the shipping carrier. 0/10 experience from beginning to end. And amazon said they cannot give me an immediate refund even though the listing is a lie. Do not order from this vendor."
iPhone 7 Plus,I ordered my iPhone on a Tuesday and got it Thursday! It came in a sealed box with all the accessories & papers. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!
iPhone 7 Plus,"Problems with the Iphone. Need an answer IMMEDIATELY.I have a problem with the iPhone 7plus I purchased last month and which my brother received in Florida and brought me to Venezuela. It came without charge and, of course, I started to charge it last Sunday (when my brother gave me the phone) and when the battery was already full, I turned it off until today. To my surprise the battery was drained, no charge at all and the phone was turned off!!!! Please help me with this situation. I am really concerned about this issue. I live in Venezuela (South America) and have no idea what to do. Please answer me ASAP. Lucia"
iPhone 7 Plus,"Stunning phone! Stunning Black phone! Best product ever from Apple. Nothing much to say about the product, as reviews are available.

One thing I noticed different was the small pin to pull out the SIM card is not available with the package. So once you pull out the stunning phone and get impatient to begin to use, you have to run around to search for a paper clip to do the job of that missing clip!"
iPhone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Wonderful at The Moment
iPhone 7 Plus,Inferior. I ordered and did the update needed and it kept rebooting would not function! Sent back! And went to Best Buy and bought the more yes now I have payments but the one I purchased now works with the Apple warranty! Don’t waste your time or money!

Purchased the phone at around $800 for and iPhone 7 plus 256gb (please note at the time of the review this was the latest iPhone out) the shipping was so fast, literally the next day and it came with so many extra accessories! I wasn't even expecting that. My boyfriend loves this phone and it runs so fast (why even have a computer?) so I bought myself a red one and now we have two."

iPhone 7,"Faulty.Love the design and a great phone but sometimes the home, power and volume buttons become unresponsive and other times the camera is just completely blank or blurred and I'm unable to take pictures. Also lags here or there. Don't really recommend."
iphone 7,"Total rip-off these phones are defective.I bought this phone back in February and it developed a hardware issue. My phone (Iphone 7 128GB) recently developed an issue in cellular signal, still searching for network and could not recognize the carrier, so i did a reset of network settings and restart the phone then the screen goes to black and white lines and the phone restart itself continuously tell i remove the SIM card or put it in airplane mode, and i have been tried another SIM cards but the problem still exist.
Thereafter, i connect it to ITunes and ITunes told me that you have to update phone to IOS V. 11 but actually i already updated my phone to IOS V.11. then i tried to update the phone but unfortunately the process failed with the unknown error (-1) and the phone currently stuck in a recovery mode and also i tried restore process and face the same error. I took very good care of this phone bear in mind, it's in near mint condition. So disappointing that they do this to people. Never buy a phone off of Amazon, its too much of an investment to risk buying from these shady sellers. Buy it from your carrier, get a protection plan and warranty otherwise you'll be stuck with a $800.00 piece of metal and glass and the seller will tell you ""It's your problem now, sorry."" I went through Apple and T-Mobile neither of the two could do anything about it."

iphone 7,"it the best one yet? I think so!'m back and it's better than ever

I was in the market for a new phone, and decided since it was the actual launch day, I'd go down to my ATT store and purchase something. I wasn't sure that I would purchase an iPhone 7 (honestly, about 80 percent sure I would) and I waited in line. The whole actual waiting part wasn't as tremendously large as it's quoted as being. I really didn't have to wait all that long, which I think is in part to a lot of people not seeing the potential in this phone.

After I purchased the phone, I immediately went and got a Charging case from the same store. This not only allows me to charge my phone, but use my headphones at the same time. I don't have a need for headphones that I can lose (AIRPODS) and I like that Apple actually gives an alternative to you, you get to use corded earpods, and if your battery case is charged (essentially an external battery), you have about 1-2 days of full fledge battery life (and I use my phone a lot) and can still use the headphones.

The speed of this one is what amazed me to be totally honest with you. I'm coming back to Apple after a small break and using a GoPhone (ZTE MAVEN) on the postpaid service. The Maven did well honestly, and I kept it around for a lot longer than I usually do. It just worked, and that can't be said for most phones. I'd experimented with iOS10 with my iPad, but I can say, it works a lot better on this than the iPad. Games, videos, even texting, are so much faster, it's hard to believe. The Digital Touch message feature is a nice touch, however, how much I'll use it I've yet to see.

Having no physical home button is not a ""biggie"" to me. There is a haptic feedback button in place of this, which is essentially a touch sensitive button, but it actually has a feeling as though you're pressing it. It's kind of how the trackpad works on the MacBooks. A nice touch. It took a little bit to get used to, and choose the ""touch"" I wanted, but after doing so, it's been easy.

I'm not displeased as many people would think about the headphone issue, as many people are. I use headphones, but so long as there is a workaround, which Apple has done, I'm not bothered. I can still use the earpods with the lightning connector. I guess it would be an inconvenience to you if your battery-case (if you bought one, or buy one) is dead, and I can actually see that being an issue. But this is why you need to watch battery levels.

The camera is EXCELLENT. I've been a photographer for the better part of my life, and can leave my Nikon at home and walk out with this and be confident that any shots I need to take, can be taken with this. HDR is a must.

Sound quality with this unit is very good, however, I must say, if you have a screen protector on the phone, you can legitimately feel the sound coming thru the speakers, thru the screen protector. Every phone that has had a screen protector that I've tested on the iPhone 7, has had this issue. All of the floor models that don't are fine. It doesn't bother me tremendously, but for a high end phone, you'd think that design would have been looked at before the phone was released.

Overall, I'm pleased, and I think I will be for the foreseeable future. But I usually love almost every phone that I've owned, so, I'm not sure how biased I actually might be. As the experience continues, I'll be sure to update my review with any updates that would be beneficial."
iphone 7,"
It happens to be the best phone on the market....Iphone 7 is pretty solid. It's best feature hands down is the waterproof, FINALLY. The speed is incredible. The Touch ID is faster than you might want. The haptic feedback home button is genius. The rose gold is stunning. I upgraded from an i6 and I am glad I did.

iphone 7,Four stars. Expensive
iphone 7,"Outright lie in the title. As previous reviewers have pointed out, this iPhone was not unlocked. For people specifically buying this to use internationally, I would recommend any other seller"
iphone 7,"
4.0 out of 5 starsa great leap from the iPhone 6s, but not enough to keep me using iPhones. This is probably what the iPhone 6 should've looked like from the beginning. That space grey was boringly ugly and tho this looks much better, it's just a little bit too late for me.

Rumors suggested a sexy deep blue or something, that would've kept me using this a tad longer and am sure Apple were about to do it ... but anyways

the phone is the typical better than last year's iPhone
better performance, not much better battery and a better camera

The performance and feel difference were great!
it just felt that much faster and felt way newer than previous upgrades have felt, the camera was way better, especially in low light and the battery was a typical iPhone batter

But there was nothing else to speak about regarding the device, you just get new software features which they optimize best for the new iPhone, so you're basically buying the latest iOS operator rather than a new phone.

There is no discovery too, you just load your backup and here you are at exactly the same homescreen trying a couple of features that are probably cool, just not cool enough.

I was scared of moving to Android, my last attempt with the Nexus 6 failed epically due to the world famous crashes and a much much worse battery life, I may have had a faulty device but that was enough to stop me from getting one of my all time want phones, the Moto X Style Edition.

So I managed to get the Moto Z and use it with the iPhone 7 for a while using the same number on two different sim cards, it didn't take me long to start reaching for the Moto Z and leave the iPhone at home all together ... and just like that I moved to Android and I think I moved to Android at the right time cuz Android was sluggish and crashy, while iOS was snappy and reliable

and I think starting iOS 7, iPhones started to degrade a little faster and later iOS versions started to become just a little bit unstable

while Android starting from Marshmallow started getting a little bit more reliable and"
iphone 7,"Awesome phone! .Honestly I love the upgrade I made to the iPhone 7 (from iPhone 6). It is fast with the latest IOS 10 and loving the 128gb. I would not recommend getting the lowest space possible which is 32gb because it sucked having the 16gb iPhone 6. Also they did a study saying the 32gb model is slower as well. The one downside I have about the phone is the phone is missing the headphone jack, but they removed it so the phone could be water resistant and so they could put in a better vibration to the phone. They also removed the home button the takes place in every iPhone before the 7, but they replaced it with a touch button that tricks you into thinking it's a real button. Don't get this phone if you already have the iPhone 6s because it will not be a huge upgrade. PS. The pictures are ones I took on this phone, not pictures of the phone."
iphone 7,"Phone is dumb as I cannot believe. . Totally ridiculous and dumb phone. I am used to Samsung, Galaxies, LQ and even other cheaper phones out there. This is my first I phone. I find it totally dumb. While understand no phone is perfect and all have certain pros and cons; for the life of me I cannot understand that the Iphone is something that people like and are willing to pay good money for it. I understand that the camera and optic characteristics of this phone are something people like. For my part, I use my phone mainly as a phone or texting device. And these are the areas where I find the phone is lacking. To name a couple. When a call enters, I do not have an option (or not always) of rejecting the call or answer with a message, there is only one option: answer. After a call from a new number, in other phones, if I touch the number it will give an opportunity to convert into a contact, call the person or text. With the iphone, if you touch the number it will call the person back. I went into the movies yesterday and, as it is customary by civilized people, I muted the bloody phone in question. But the phone decided to ring loud when a call entered. Another thing that bugs the hell out of me is that the phone decides that, since I am driving, ""it will not disturb me and let any calls enter..."" I thought I had bought a phone, not a parent. Before you buy any phone from this company make sure you give it a good test and make sure that the actions that you take for granted in your other phones will be included with this new phone and good luck
"
iphone 7,"Heads up about the new Haptic home button, it doesnt work etip or rubber gloves on THE HOME BUTTON ONLY WORKS WITH BARE HANDS.

This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone. No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves. None of them worked with my phone. So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind. Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold! I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone.

HERE IS A SOLUTION, ........with extra steps.

I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:

Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on.

This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot. Then to unlock your iPhone 7, press the sleep button on the right of the phone, then press the Assistive Touch dot, touch the home button and enter your SIX digit pass code.

I want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into all of the extra steps to open the phone, because the extra steps are EACH time you have to access your phone.

OTHER CONS

1. I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard. It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5. Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen. I have tried it on every sensitivity level.
2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works. Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over.

I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects."
iphone 7,"I hate the 7; buy a 5 instead. The iPhone 7 is a serious step backward by Apple. Prior to this, my biggest complaint was the battery life. However, I could have the phone plugged in charging, while listening to music on my headset or talking on the phone. With only 1 plug now, instead of 2, you can either charge your phone OR use your headset, but not both. Further my old headsets do not fit the 7, and the 7 headset won't fit my iMac. I bought two splitters and adapters and the splitters did not work, and the adapter is hard to keep up with.

Second, the touch screen is insensitive and about 1/3 of my touches are not detected. There is a heavy and a light touch but when holding the phone with one hand and / or typing quickly, you cannot control the different touch levels.

In the past, when you bought an Apple product, you got a solid operating system that had been thoroughly tested and you did not have to update all the time. Not anymore; you can spend as much time updating your phone and apps as you spend using it now.

Many of the new features are a nuisance unless you are a teenager, and you cannot turn them off, and they constantly try to cram the Apple Subscription Music service down your throat. I want to turn that feature off, and not be asked about it another hundred times.

I loved my old iPhone 5 despite the short battery life. Given the computing power of the phone, I could understand that, and had back up battery packs I could use. But I hate my iPhone 7 and would highly recommend against buying one."
iphone 7,"Improvements over the 6S!! The iPhone 7 offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note.

- Better display (wider colour gamut)
- Better taptic engine
- 5 grams lighter
- IP67 Water and dust resistance
- Way better A10 Fusion CPU
- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p)
- Rear camera have OIS
- Better low light performance
- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE
- Slightly better battery life
- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)

The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note. Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!"
iphone 7,"Great except for missing headphone jack, I upgraded to the iPhone 7 and have to say that most of my experience has been good. The larger size was a change but after a few weeks I really like that. The one main complaint is the removal of the headphone jack. My home stereo system has a connection, but is not blue tooth enabled, which means I either no longer listen to my music on my home entertainment system, or I now have to buy a new stereo, plus now my earphones are basically worthless. Plus my truck isn't enabled either, so now I just listen on the phone. The jury is still out as to whether I'm going to downgrade, as the other features are nice, if not for the headphone jack change it would have been a 5 star. If you only have blue tooth devices to connect to, go ahead and upgrade."
iphone 7,"Great Phone. The iPhone 7 is a great phone for everyday tasks. The phone has a very solid build with a metal back and a matte black finish that doesn’t slip in your hand. The matte black also doesn’t show fingerprints like most shiny phones do. The front of the phone is a durable glass that does show fingerprints but cleans easily and is scratch resistant. The power and volume buttons are placed nicely on the sides where they are rarely accidentally pressed but can be easily pressed when needed. The overall size of the phone is great with it not being too large where you can’t access all of the screen with one hand but is still large enough to easily read any text and watch any videos.
The iPhone 7 also has a new home button that doesn’t physically move like previous iPhone’s did. Having previously owned an iPhone 6 the button is very different on this new phone but is very easy to get used to. The amount of haptic feedback is adjustable so you can make it feel exactly how you want. After just a few hours with the phone the new home button seemed just as natural as the previous home button. Included in this home button is a fingerprint scanner that is much faster than the scanner in the previous phones.
Although the iPhone 7 was the first iPhone without a headphone jack, it isn’t a large issue for day to day use. There are many Bluetooth headphone options that allow you to listen to music or other media while also charging your phone. Since the phone doesn’t have an audio jack there is another speaker on the bottom that makes the speaker quality much better and louder than previous iPhones.
The front and rear facing cameras on the phone are both very good for their respective tasks. For those looking for a more professional photograph the iPhone 7 plus may be the better option. For the everyday user that isn’t serious into photography they both take very good pictures.
Overall the iPhone is a great improvement from previous generations of iPhones. The overall build quality and design make it a very good looking and durable phone. This phone is great for those who use their phones for everyday communications, playing games, and just about every other task a smart phone can do."
iphone 7,"My phone stopped working 11 days after the warranty! DO NOT BUY. This phone is a ticking time bomb! 11 days after the warrant expired the phone went into a rebooting loop. After spending hours on end with the apple support tech they asked me to go to the nearest apple store. I waited 3 hours for them to plug my phone in and tell me they are going to have to ship the phone off. The stated that I could get an express replacement for over $300. Terrible customer service and the company is loosing touch with quality and customer care! Never buy this product

iphone 7,"The iPhone 7, a giant leap in cellphone technology ...The iPhone 7, a giant leap in cellphone technology? Not quite.
This phone IS advanced but fragile. AppleCare and insurance is a necessity.
Removing the headphone jack seems to have caused some major problems. It is a fragile little flower of a cell phone. Yes it might be waterproof, but that doesn't help if it does not work.
I have been loyal apple user for years and yet within 30 days I am awaiting my second replacement iPhone 7 - on the first phone the charging port (and headphone port now) failed and actually pushed the cable out (ghost in the machine?). That was in the first week - it was replaced and the Second phone lasted 14 days before the same port failed completely. No headphones. No charging. No backing up!! Big bummer!!
It's not Steve Job's apple anymore but I can't see another device that appeals!!!"
iphone 7,"No headphone jack? Fail.'ve had Apple iPhone's for years, and I only own Apple computers and iPads, but I hate this iPhone7 so much I think I'll try turning it back in and getting an iPhone 6. This is my problem: I teach fitness classes at a dozen different gyms all with different sound systems, and because the iPhone doesn't have a headphone jack, I can no longer connect to their sound system. Yes, the iPhone came with an adapter, but that 2 inch adapter was quickly lost with all the running around that I do. SO, I bought a dozen inexpensive adapters from China to have plenty of extras on hand (about $1 each as opposed to the Apple price of $9) but when I plug them in, they work for about 10 seconds, then they stop working with a message on my iPhone that says something like, ""This accessory is not supported."" This whole situation has become an expensive, inconvenient mess for me. It seems that with the new iPhone, I cannot easily charge and listen to my headphones at the same time, and that if I lose my headphone adapter I'm forced to buy the expensive iPhone brands. Someone told me that they got rid of the headphone jacks so that people would be forced to by the blue tooth ear buds. Apple! This is a disaster for me, and it really does appear that you engineered this inconvenience just to sell more accessories. How about thinking about what would be most convenient for your customers, who are paying $800 for an iPhone?"
iphone 7,"Screw this phone!!!!Grrrrr! I hate so much about this new phone!!
I hate that they did away with the head phone jack! It's so annoying. I'm not getting my voicemails, and it's the glitchyest iPhone yet. I've been an iPhone lover for more than 7 years! And now I'm thinking about the pixel 😠
Booo Apple boo!"
iphone 7,"Worth the money. I would just like to share that when Apple says the phone is water resistant, they mean it. The thing still works after being submerged in about 5 feet of water for almost an hour. It was still playing music down there and started chiming with emails as soon as I fished it out of there."

iphone 7,"Don't Buy the Hype.I bought this mistake in August after hearing all the hype about the need to have an I phone. Big mistake. I am now stuck with an over priced piece of crap tha for the next two year. I would have less issues if this phone for the money included high quality material .three weeks after I bought it it slipped off the coffee table 18 inches high A ND THE SCREEN CRACKED! I then found out their was only one Apple Store in Tucson. Once I finally got there they want to charge 129 dollars for replacement glass. After s few heated words turn out they realized I had insurance -- so only 29 dollars please and even though I had an appointment there would be several hours of wait time. By the way we have fine selection an Apple labeled junk for you to look at and max your credit card out on while you wait. I asked if they would please install the screen cover I had brought with me.. They said yes, then several hours later when I got back my repaired apple I was asked to wait another 20 minutes, then approached and told Apple does not install third party equipment, but they could sell me a protector and install it - for 39 dollars. I left in disgust.
So far the list of apps recommended for Apple aren't available, I can't import my music, and there's no such thing as an working app. Siri sucks. My bar strength has gone from four bars to two if I'm Lucky. Bleck!!! Buy and Android!

iphone 7,"Mediocare phone.
Honestly I'm disappointed... I can't believe I paid $800 + for this.. It's just not worth it.. This should be no more than $500 the most. IPhones are way overrated and overpriced.. Anyway I returned the phone."
iphone 7,"Great for Photography. he iPhone 7 isn't much of an improvement from the six but, it's all the difference if like to frequently take pictures. The camera I've noticed is easier to focus with and is high quality. Also, the 128 GB storage is very convenient for pictures and videos so you don't get the "" not enough storage "" notification while downloading an app or taking a video.

As a person who's has Androids for a long time, I was finally convinced to try an iPhone. I got the 7 and I must say that it is great! The only complaint I have is the lack of headphone jack.

Each year, Apple Inc. launches a better version of the iPhone into the market. I agree, the iPhone 7 is the highest preforming smartphone in the market to date. The A10 Fusion chip, whose function is to power the iPhone 7, is comprised of four distinct cores: two low-energy cores designed for easier tasks while ensuring low power usage and two high-performance cores to handle the most intense tasks. When testing my iPhone 7, I noticed that it had an internal storage of 128GB and the speed of some personal computers. The phone is ideal for university students who are always on the go and store everything on their phones. This is a pretty big deal since one of the biggest issues with the iPhone's was storage.
Design
The iPhone 7 has an elegant new design that comes in five finishes, silver, gold, rose gold, black, and jet black. The black finish is characterized by an anodized matte look. The jet black finish is consummated through anodization and innovative polish, perfecting its glossy finish. An exclusively and perfectly reengineered enclosure makes the phone water resistant while offering maximum protection against dust, spills, or even splashes.
Screen
The iPhone 7 screen is more improved as compared to iPhone 6s, which makes it comfortable for the user even in the harsh midday glare. For instance, I can comfortably read an article in the sunlight using my phone. Also, the screen is capable of supporting a wider gamut of color, making videos, as well as photos to pop with saturated and vivacious hue.
Apps
Launching Apps on the iPhone 7 is quicker than other Smartphones. Its processor works very fast and is capable of running high graphic games and supporting convoluted photo-editing applications. The iPhone's battery is capable of lasting longer than a day when used normally.
Camera
The iPhone 7 is built with a single 12-megapixel iSight camera whose performance is incomparable to that of the iPhone 6s. The aperture lens of this phone is wider, f1.8, allowing penetration of more light, making it possible to take better photos in the dark or low-light. The iPhone 7 is comprised of an optical image stabilizer that was initially limited to only superior Plus Smartphone models. Also, the phone has a TrueTone flash which is brighter when compared to that of iPhone 6s. The color of the photos is remarkable on the iPhone 7 due to the P3 color gamut. Its distinctive features, such as the iOS 10 can allow a third-party application to effectively access RAW data from its iSight camera. All these features put the iPhone 7 at the top of the list when it comes to smartphones."
iphone 7,"Brilliant for New users , but nothing special for iphone 6/6 plus owners. I ordered this phone from official Apple store.
Let me tell you my story, i was android dude and i kinda hated Iphone , you know why ? because people keep buying them not because of needs but for being more fashionable or being popular among the friends or general community.
I upgraded my phone from samsung galaxy s5 and i had a choice :
1. Samung galaxy s7
2. Iphone 7
I checked every forum on the internet and it was really hard for me to make this decision really . Mostly i appreciate phones specifications and the only thing in which samsung was better was the screen resolution ( i dont really need 2k display -_-) and camera which needs some kind of knowledge to take good pictures but iphone is more like easier.
I did not buy iphone 7 plus because it is far too big for me and my pocket .
I like phone itself but ios system is not comfortable for me , because android has way too much freedom , but i won't write less than 5 stars because of my tastes about ios system.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY GOT IPHONE 6 or 6 PLUS IF YOU REALLY BUY PHONE FOR ITS SPECIFICATIONS OR FEATURES DON't UPGRADE , I HAD A LOT OF TIME WITH IPHONE 6 AND THERE IS WAY TOO SMALL AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCES.

PERSONALLY I THINK THAT NOBODY SHOULD UPGRADE PHONE EVERY YEAR OR 2 TIMES PER YEAR. AIN'T NO COMPANY UPGRADES THEIR GADGETS 1-2 TIMES PER YEAR SO THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY NEED UPGRADE SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF IT. WAIT 1-2 YEAR AND THEN GO UPGRADE

UPDATE ###1 : i get used to it, phone works perfectly and seems very fast. I like it and maybe i won't change it :)"
iphone 7,Five stars. Great Phone.
iphone 7,Switching to Galaxy for reasons.  have been using iphone for past 5 years. iphone4 for 3 yrs and then iphone 6 for past 2 yrs. Each phone's ringtone and any clicking sound stop working after about 2 years of use. No damage caused by me at all. When I called Apple they said it's out of warranty and it would cost about $300 to replace or repair the phone. This happened for both iphone. I read the book Steve Jobs and I realized Apple's strategy is to integrate everything and hard to repair them. I think they don't care about customer's burden for repair. I am definitely switching to Galaxy for my next smart phone. Strongly recommend not to use iphone.

iphone 7,Nothing can beat an iphone
Iphone 7 Plus,"That the iphone is having issues with multi touch. I didnt like that the screen wasn't from the apple company
"
Iphone 7 Plus,Great phone. Amazing thank you
Iphone 7 Plus,"starsTHIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED- FRAUDULENT ADVERTISING. If you can only use a phone with specific carriers, it is NOT UNLOCKED. This phone is NOT UNLOCKED. I could not put it on my Verizon service. The worker at the Verizon store explained to me that Apple made the 7 series specific to particular carriers, which must have upset many people, because the phones were changed back to unlockable with the 8 series.
What's maybe even more upsetting to me is that because at a glance this seller/item has an overall very high rating (which must be due to fake reviews), I didn't look at the reviews before I bought the phone. And apparently Amazon does't look at the reviews, either, because there have been so many reviews with complaints that are similar to mine, and also complaints of receiving fake iPhones (that did not seem to be an issue with mine) , yet Amazon continues to allow the sale of this item with apparently multiple, false representations. That is reprehensible, and illegal."
Iphone 7 Plus,Worth it! I am a genuinely satisfied customer. This phone is amazing it’s like brand new! Came before expected shipping date! I got a better quality item then expected ( I bought the iPhone 7 Plus from wireless mall sales) I was expecting scratches all over the back but there’s only one scuff on the bumper of the phone that is easily covered up by a case. Everything works fine only issue is that it doesn’t come with headphones but that’s fine because I paid a great price! Would recommend buying from wireless mall sales I don’t know the quality of the other providers.
Iphone 7 Plus,"starsGreat price, great quality & great phone. I ordered this phone on Friday night and got a knock on my door Monday morning, my phone arrived (maybe because I live in Florida), but totally unexpected. Honestly I was skeptical because it said used & didn’t believe I could find a 128GB silver for less than anyone is selling it for. Thanks so much Gizmo! So far no complaints and a great buy :)"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Excellent first time experience with refurbished products. This was my first experience buying a refurbished product. Initially I had a concern about the quality of the phone I’ll be getting, battery life, screen quality, …. What I got was practically a new phone but without the original packaging, charger or headphones. The phone is in mint condition, excellent screen, no scratches whatsoever and looks like new. As an added bonus the phone came with a screen protector installed. Love it.
The 256gb is a breeze compared to my current 16gb. Like moving from a studio to a mansion :)"
Iphone 7 Plus,Oops. I ordered the wrong phone returned it I had a seven. Z

Iphone 7 Plus,No Compatible With Sprint. Overall Bad Experience
Iphone 7 Plus,"Mint Condition. I loved everything about the phone. No scratches, blemishes or anything else. It was like a brand new phone.
You guys shouldn’t miss your opportunity to get one."
Iphone 7 Plus,Phone review. The phone came with technical problems when I first got it the day I got it it was messed up. It wouldn’t let me make FaceTime or regular calls and when it first cuts on it take 15 minutes or more for it to actually cut on. It took me over 2 weeks to figure out what the problem was. I had to get Apple employee in customer service to run a diagnostic on this phone and I thought it was something else but no they sent me a messed up phone. Maybe it wasn’t their fault but yea that’s my review and I’m not pleased .

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Best. Phone. Ever. Takes incredible pictures and operates very quickly. Love the huge screen.
Iphone 7 Plus,"4.0 out of 5 starsnot compatible with verizon/sprint but it’s UNLOCKED. i give this company that sold me the phone a very low four stars not because of the phone itself but the mere fact that the product description does not include that there is no compatibility with verizon/sprint companies even though its supposedly unlocked. this caused me to go through so much extra trouble to get my phone to have service. BUT i can say this iphone 7 plus was totally worth the money because it is impeccable. for a refurbished phone, the battery life is great, the speed and performance is top notch and there is 256GB of space; which is where the other four stars come in."
Iphone 7 Plus,Description isn't helpful. The phone came scratched all over the screen and one of the speakers doesn’t work. I didn’t bring either the headphones nor the adaptor

Iphone 7 Plus,"The new IPhone 7 Plus is great for any individual that enjoys using their phone regularly for the internet, texting, work, or taking pictures! We will go over the IPhone 7 Plus’s camera, durability, storage, and sound features.

Camera
The IPhone 7 plus has a new double 12MP back camera with a 6 element lens. MP stand for “megapixel”. This is the standard unit equivalent to one million pixels. Pixels are what cameras use to create photos, and bring the picture into focus; so the more the better! The double camera provides you with 25% brighter colors and in result, takes portrait- like photos. Additionally, the front camera is 7MP for taking great selfies. In past models the camera would get fuzzy over time or had what looked like blurs on the screen.

Durability
Apple Inc. showcases that the new IPhone is water, splash, and dust resistant. They state that the phone can withstand being submerged in up to 1 meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes, and suffer no damage. This is useful if an accident may occur around water, or even if you get caught in the rain.

Storage
The IPhone 7 Plus has more storage than ever! They now offer the choice between 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The 64 GB was previously the highest storage amount available. Anyone using their storage for pictures or work could use that space easily. On the new upgrade there are many more storage options, however the higher storage options are pricier.

Sound
The speakers now project twice as much sound, and have a great quality sound. On the previous model, the speaker was on the bottom edge of the phone, on one side of the charger jack. On the iPhone 7 Plus, there are speakers along the whole bottom edge of the phone, which almost doubles the sound from the last model. When you play music out loud, it sounds similar to laptop speakers! With this IPhone upgrade however, there is not a headphone jack located on the bottom anymore for music or phone calls, so an adapter or wireless headphones need to be used."
Iphone 7 Plus,Great condition. Phone in great shape as described!
Iphone 7 Plus,Lies!Lies! Bad mechant!! Lies in the tile. What I got is Japanese version not US version!! I am super angry with it!!! But I aready used it...
Iphone 7 Plus,"I have a gold 7 Plus with 128 GB. After having used Android phones since Android first came out, I decided that I wanted to see what an iPhone was like, just for a change. I had an LG V10, and while the phone itself was OK, I wasn't thrilled with the latest Android update, so that's another reason I switched. Also, I have an iMac and wanted to have a phone that could share the calendar, photos, and more.

I chose to get the 7 Plus rather than the 8 Plus because, after comparing the two, I just couldn't see paying more for something that isn't much different from the 7 Plus. I've had the phone for about a week now, and all I can say is, I wish I had switched to an iPhone much sooner. I really love this phone! I haven't used all the features that are available, and will update when I've discovered more.

Pros:
1. It's very user-friendly. I thought that I would have a big learning curve switching from Android, but I didn't. Maybe that's because I already had an Apple product, but even if I hadn't, I don't think it would be that difficult, especially since I didn't have much difficulty switching from a PC to a Mac.
2. The dual speakers are wonderful. I've had many different brands of phones, and the speakers on this one are finally loud enough to where I can have a phone conversation with them on, and hear perfectly.
3. It quickly paired with my LG Tone Infinim headphones, and my 2012 Buick LaCrosse.
4. It has a wonderful camera, and the pictures are much clearer and sharper than my V10, which had a pretty good camera.
5. Siri is definitely the best assistant out there, and I'm going to use her a lot.
6. I like the fact that one can still assign photos and specific ringtones to contacts.
7. It had no problem accepting Amazon Prime Video and Music.
8. The clock, if used as an alarm, is great. However, it has one quirk. If you want to use the snooze feature, you can't leave the phone on. You don't turn the phone completely off, but you do lock it with a quick click of the power button. I find that kind of strange, but that's how Apple decided to do it.
9. I have small hands, and it feels comfortable to hold. My V10 was a hair larger, so this phone seems a bit better comfort-wise.
10. Apple Support is awesome!

Cons:

1. I hate the home button. It's really irritating to have to press that thing instead of swiping left or right when I want to access something. In this respect, they're way behind Android. The only other phone I had with a home button was a Samsung S5, and I never liked it. I'm glad Apple has done away with it, and will probably trade mine in for an 8 Plus next year.
2. The battery is pretty awful. I don't use my phone all that much, and that thing drains pretty quickly. I can't imagine what it would do if I were a heavy user, complete with videos and games.
3. As another reviewer pointed out, the head phones that come with the phone are very uncomfortable, so I'll use either Bluetooth or use the adapter with some that I already have.

That's all I can think of for negatives. If I find any more, I'll add them in an update.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT WARRANTIES:

I already have an extended warranty on the phone via AT&T. However, I've been asking lots of questions about Apple Care, and may still get that. I was told by an Apple Support person that I should keep the Asurion one because Apple doesn't cover it if it's lost or stolen. I've only had one cell phone stolen, but there could be a next time, especially since a lot of thieves like the iPhone because it keeps its resale value longer.

However, with Apple Care, if I have a problem with my phone, they'll send me an immediate replacement, even before they get my old one. Of course, I have to give a credit card number just in case they don't get the old one back.

Bottom line, do some in-depth research regarding extra coverage for this phone. It's an expensive investment, and you don't want to get stuck having to pay full-price for another one if something goes wrong."
Iphone 7 Plus,"I’ve never written a one star review in my life, but this deserves it. Phone came fast and as described, but a week later it would constantly freeze or malfunction. Fast forward a month, I went to charge it (15%) and it never turned on after that. I took it to Apple and even they couldn’t fix it or tell me what was wrong and they gave me a brand new iPhone. Save yourself the hassle and order directly from Apple as I do now; much cheaper also."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. all fantastic!
Iphone 7 Plus,Hey I would like to promo the phone. Cause I feel like I would bring more customers to the buy this product
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. love it
Iphone 7 Plus,"I ordered this product and it was packaged horribly, when i opened the package, the phone didn't even turn on. I tried to charge it but it just kept shutting on and off even though it was on 100%. The only good thing about my package was that it came with a charger bt the rest i give a 1/10. Im insanely disappointed. This was a waste of $850."
Iphone 7 Plus,100% satisfied. Exactly how i expected. Brand new!!
Iphone 7 Plus,"It surpassed my expectations. It came exactly how it was suppose too and I am having no problems with it.
"
Iphone 7 Plus,One Star. BTW the phone is now 600 dollars
Iphone 7 Plus,Three Stars. Is Ok
Iphone 7 Plus,Apple is awful. If I could give massive negative reviews on Apple products I would. They suck badly. User friendly went right out the window. iPhone 7s is the worst phone I have ever owned.
Iphone 7 Plus,LOVE. I got mine from buybackworld and it's not fake. I had att on it then boost and it automatically adapted
Iphone 7 Plus,Three Stars. IMEI of phone box hidden
Iphone 7 Plus,I received a fake iPhone 7 plus and it was missing the home button and when i called about the phone they told me to wait into 2 weeks.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Although phone is sold as unlocked, I tried to use this phone in Brazil and it's locked. When I called apple, they identified that it was locked by a USA carrier, but couldn't unlock. I am very frustrated, because this was for a friend and now I have to take the phone back to USA and return it."
Iphone 7 Plus,Excellent phone very fast it is unlock work perfect on Verizon network
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. 100% perfect
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. I loved the phone had no problems.
would like another one lol"
Iphone 7 Plus,Great phone. Bought this phone for my future wife.... she completely adores it... great purchase... you wont regret it.
Iphone 7 Plus,"I bought one of these to replace my iPhone 6 and was worried that it was too big but, so far, I love it. I have to use two hands to operate the phone but I find myself using it instead of my iPad Mini. There are times when I need a smaller phone (when I'm running) but I'll just carry the iPhone 6 for those times.
I like the screen, battery life, radios (WiFi strength is a lot better than my iPhone 6). The camera is a lot better but that doesn't matter much to me. So great phone if you don't want to spend your money on the 8, 8+ or X."
Iphone 7 Plus,"hi , i have a youtube channel
i should love to promode your item
let me know."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five STars. Very good Job
Iphone 7 Plus,"SO DISAPPOINTED!!!! I am so disappointed with Amazon.. I am a Prime customer who had never had any qualms about trusting Amazon. I bought for my wife this phone all along thinking it is fine yet it has issues with sound. It doesn't ring. It is not new as advertised!! She can not register it for Apple care because of this!! I need my money back! I am so much disappointed!
"

Iphone 7 Plus,I ordered an iPhone 7 from y'all a couple months ago around April and it came up broke and I just know got access to a form of technology and I would like it if you would give me another one.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Hello my name is Ryan and I am a BIG FAN of IPhone's I am 13 years old and I always wanted a IPhone, but my Mom and Dad don't want to buy for me because they are always saying that they don't have enough money. I really want to review this phone on YouTube on my channel Rayblen PB and show all of my reviewers. Also, I want to have a better quality when I am recording my video's because my camera on my tablet which has bad quality. And plus all my friends have phones and I really feel left out because I can only talk to them at school and when I see them out side and that's another reason I want the IPhone 7 plus in Matte Black. And I will really appreciate if I get to review it on my channel and acually know how to feel to have one of the best phone in the whole world
"
Iphone 7 Plus,"The model information is false. In the order details it claims to be model A1778, but after having problems with the phone we took it to an Apple store and it is not the same model. This meant they couldn't work on the phone in any way because there was no proof it was legitimately purchased. Even after showing the Amazon order details this wasn't enough confirmation that the phone wasn't stolen because of the conflicting information, they couldn't tell us the actual model number for this reason. I have requested the correct model number information from PureMobile and am awaiting a response.

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. perfect phone!!. look like a new one
Iphone 7 Plus,"...Don't believe the hype. Where do I begin? First the good. The speakers are fantastic - stereo, bass, volume, clarity. Two bottom firing speakers and one coming from the earpiece. The best speakers I've heard on any mobile device.

Now the bad and the ugly. Scrolling, believe it or not. A simple flick barely moves a web page any distance. It's almost like friction slows it down. The keyboard, whilst great at prediction, is an absolute nightmare for numbers & punctuation. It easily ruins my flow. Third up is lack of confirmation when sending. Send an email and hope for the best. No ""message sent"" and sometimes it wasn't sent. Fourth, rearranging & sorting images. Ya can't. Folder management... isn't. Trying to save media from Safari? Well that's hit or miss. If you don't press the exact amount of pressure you might just get up pop-up option to save that you must use a second finger to save or you might get a sustaining link or the picture might just pop out.

Now onto music. All of my music is on memory card and Google Drive. In other words, Sayonara. Either that or I must upload my 3000 songs to iTunes. Wanna send music to your friend via email or WhatsApp? Impossible. Wanna extract music sent to you? Pull out your laptop and get iTunes.

Where's the intuitive part? More like a walled garden.

Touch ID. I'm coming from Huawei Ascend Mate 7. With one touch I awaken and unlock my device. With iPhone 7, you must press twice with differing degrees of pressure but be careful. If you press too quickly, that pop up message will disappear & you'll have to hunt for the message. That's because the pull down notifications aren't very informative.

*****The worst part is that I must enter my card for Apple Pay as well as ID. As I'm returning my phone, I deleted my card from one of them. Guess what, Apple literally won't allow me to delete my bank card from the other.****

Which brings me to the App Store. Some iPhone apps are more polished. Most have no ads so expect to pay for them. How much? Anybody's guess. Takes four clicks - get, install, buy, Touch ID. Far more convoluted than Android. Here's the best part, no price is listed. So I bought these apps & I'm never told how much I'm charged. I can't remove my bank info & my bank balance hasn't changed.

If Apple users think this is intuitive, it's simply because they've never used any other device.

On Android I can extract vids images and music from any browsers or messages. I can use apps to download free stuff. I can use browsers that allow me to name a file as I save it and save it where I choose. If I want to send someone a song, I can. With iPhone, I feel like a child on lock down.

Let's not get into the limited storage and lack of headset jack. I use Bluetooth too but when my battery is low, that's a problem & I refuse to carry a dongle.

Compared to Android flagships, it just looks cheap. Visible plastic antenna, a protruding camera that that makes the phone rock when flat, and those bezels - big forehead, big chin, love handles. Looks very dated

In many ways it just feels like a beginner's phone. A quality device to post you meals on instagram, browse Facebook and post on twitter. Takes a very good photo as well.

As it comes very well set up to sync with other Apple devices and it doesn't allow for outside music, if you're already invested in Apple's ecosystem you'll probably like 7 just fine. If not, you'll no longer have access to much of your stuff w/o a major headache.

So when you hear that iPhones are more intuitive and just work, that's simply not true. Clearly high end Androids have caught up and in many ways surpass iPhone just as they have in build quality. Saving media, Touch ID, commandeering bank info, keyboard, flexibility and especially compatibility are just horrible compared to my Huawei flagship. I can't even reorder apps so I'm constantly flipping between screens.

It's a well made but very basic phone with limited compatibility. iPhone users will be at home because it's the same app tray Apple has been serving up for years, with same dated icons. If you're accustomed to high end Androids and actually utilize what they have to offer, you'll feel as if you've downgraded.

This iPhone is a very basic device & it is no more intuitive than modern day Android flagships."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Not truly ""Unlocked"". I bought this iPhone unlocked but found out I was not able to use other SIM cards with it. Tried various SIM cards without success. Emailed Customer Service and was told it was my fault somehow."

"
Iphone 7 Plus,"INTERNATIONAL VERSION NOT US VERSION. LISTING LIES. So, first and foremost, this listing title is a lie. This is NOT a US version unlocked iPhone 7 plus 256gb. It is an international version Iphone 7 plus 256gb. That means it cannot be used on any CDMA networks in the US such as Verizon or sprint. I know this because I tried to activated this phone on both these carriers. This phone can be activated on GSM networks such as AT&T or T-Mobile. But do not expect to be able to activate this phone in sprint, Verizon, or US cellular. I wasted 2 hours of my day going from store to store trying to activated this phone on sprint or Verizon. Furthermore, the shipping carrier left my $1000 iPhone in my open garage for everyone to see. When I got the text notification that my package was delivered, I went downstairs to check the mail. I opened the door to my garage and saw a group of individuals lurking around garage entrance where the shipping carrier left the package. When they saw me they ran straight to the street. Had I not been home to go get my package, these kids would have stolen by package left OUT IN THE OPEN by the shipping carrier. 0/10 experience from beginning to end. And amazon said they cannot give me an immediate refund even though the listing is a lie. Do not order from this vendor."

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. was very good
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Phone looks great
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. Awesome case, recommend."
Iphone 7 Plus,One Star. Expensive. 
Iphone 7 Plus,"This is a top class phone but expensive to buy. It is not a huge step up from the iPhone 6S Plus we owned but there are several good improvements. I have used this iPhone 7 Plus for many months to really judge how well it performs. It features high speed with a quad core CPU driven at 2.34 GHz. The AnTuTu benchmark was 178438 which is faster than my iPad Pro which I use as my laptop computer every day. For me that was an impressive benchmarking performance as I haven’t touched my tablet computer in over a year since I got my iPad Pro. This phone just performs well and it is noticeable in browsing, syncing with iTunes and using apps. My iPhone 6 S Plus was benchmarked at 136477 so the iPhone 7 Plus is 31 % more powerful.

The iPhone 7 plus features dual stereo speakers with twice the volume of my iPhone 6 S Plus. It is a noticeable difference and I love it while playing music, watching videos or even making hands free phone calls.

One major change is that your new headphones that come with the phone uses the lightning connector and there is no stereo phone jack on the iPhone. The stereo quality is excellent and I like it. One downside is that you will not be able to use your headphones and charge your iPhone at the same time. That doesn't bother me as the battery capacity and performance on this iPhone is very good. At the end of the day I usually have 50 to 70% or more charge on the phone when I plug it in to charge it. My wife uses her phone continually during the day and she may have to recharge hers before the end of the day. The battery is 2900 mAh in capacity and it allows you to talk for up to 21 hours. That is about 1 hour longer battery life compared to my iPhone 6S Plus. That is also about 13 hours of use while on the internet.

If for some reason you want to use your old iPhone earbuds or your headphones then the unit does come with an adapter to convert the lightning connector to a standard stereo plug with a 3.5mm plug.

The camera on the iPhone 7 is exceptional. The phone actually has two rear facing cameras. One is for normal range photos and the other is for longer range photos. The latest update to the operating system allows you to take outstanding portrait style photos that uses both cameras to achieve a Bokeh effect. This is where the subject is clearly in focus and the background is not and this type of photo is normally done with expensive cameras with quality lenses.

The phone also features up to 2 times optical and 10 times digital zoom with 12 MP rear camera. We attend a lot of football games and the ability to zoom in is impressive and it produces a high quality photo. The camera also allows you to have an up to 6 times zoom on videos that you take. The photos and videos that I have taken are impressive and the optical stabilization helps you to take those long distance shots. The front camera is a 7 Mega pixel for those all important selfies. You can also take a panorama selfie for larger groups.

We ordered the large 256 GB memory capacity but 32, 128, 256 optional. The vast majority of people will not need that much memory.
The display is exceptional quality with 401 PPI resolution I love watching videos on the screen and using Hi-Res apps.

A powerful new feature in this phone is that it is rated IP67 Which is dust tight and water tight for up to 1 meter of submersion (39.37 inches) for 30 minutes. Since many phones are damaged by getting them wet this is a great feature to protect your expensive phone investment.

My only problem that I have had with the phone is that one day the screen went black and showed only a spinning dotted wheel. I could not do anything. I could not turn it off, reset it or use any feature. I found out that I had to press the power button and the volume down button simultaneously and the phone reset and immediately came on. I believe this problem was caused by me having the phone on and I inadvertently called myself and pressed several buttons at the same time. The phone went into the Twilight Zone. That was caused by my problem and not the phone.

Overall this is a great phone which a lot of power and with a great camera and features. I rate it at 5 stars."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great product exactly what was described and super fast shipping
Iphone 7 Plus,"Great phone and awesome camera.
Best iphone I had so farz"

Iphone 7 Plus,Great deal and fast shipping. iPhone is working perfectly in my country (UAE) no connectivity problems. The only problem with iPhone 7 is the hiss noise which is a general problem. Apple said it will replace your phone if you experience this problem.
Iphone 7 Plus,Iphone 7 plus. Ok

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. very nice phone and work perfectly in my country Dominican Republic.
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. PERFECT
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good mobile Phone !
Iphone 7 Plus,Gotta have this. I finally have this infamous iPhone 7 Plus after waiting in vain in the middle of the night (around 2 a.m ) finally have my new phone.
Iphone 7 Plus,"One Star. No orginal box , badddd"
Iphone 7 Plus,Three Stars. ok.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Avoid! Doesn't work as a phone! Even after warranty replacement.  The device is cool but it doesn't work as a phone. A warranty replacement did not resolve anything. I never experienced anything like this with my previous iPhones. I often have to answer calls up to 5 times before someone can hear me and the cell service drops out sporadically.

The Bluetooth is totally broken, cuts in and out with the hands-free in my car, defeating the point of hands-free. Bluetooth music connections are choppy and also disconnects every 10-30 minutes. Other people online complain about this same phenomenon.

I'm seriously considering selling it and buying a 6S but I wouldn't feel right selling a fundamentally flawed product to someone else. Again, replacing it with a new one at the Apple store from a newer production batch fixed none of these problems. I tried resetting everything and set up the replacement as a new phone just in case there was something wrong in my backup, but the problems persist."
Iphone 7 Plus,"The phone is awesome! Great price, delivered quickly without hassle. As for the phone itself, it has a battery that lasts for several days (depending on usage), far superior to my now aging iPhone 5, and is super fast! The screen is big and beautiful and I love the 'feel' of the home button, which no longer depresses (presses in).

Highly recommended!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great device highly recommended
Iphone 7 Plus,"I know it didn't get a design rebuff, but the display is absolutely gorgeous, the thing is freaking fast, the camera is way better, and all complains I might have seemed to be software related, and Apple polishing 10.2 seems to fix quite a few.

I'm really happy with this product, and while I've been upgrading yearly for ages now, I was considering skipping this year, I'm glad I didn't."
Iphone 7 Plus,"I love my iPhone 7 Plus. Here is a breakdown of my favs and not so favs, and I'm not gonna go into crazy details just major things from a buyer's perspective.

FAVS
Battery. This is one of the best things on this not so little device! I love it that I don't have to worry about charging it through the day. I leave it charging at night and I don't need to charge it again until I get home from work (and I have to say I still have battery left at night around 60 or 50% that's a lot!) and also keep in mind that the Plus has a bigger battery than the regular 7.

Design: The design is just beautiful. I got the Jet Black and I was worried it was going to be hard to maintained as I have read about the fingerprints, scratches, etc. But let me tell you is not bad at all and I do have OCD when it comes to my devices. Would I choose the same design again? Hell yeah it looks very cool and beautiful, if you are debating about the Jet Black or the regular Black go for the Jet.

Screen, quality and speed: Spectacular! I love the vivid colors perfect for playing games or watching movies! Speed is amazing once you lay your thumb on the home button it unlocks your phone in a second! very impressive.

Not my cup of tea:
Bezels: I really wish that they made the bezels smaller, it is a large phone so I wished they Apple would've thought better about making it more manageable. It is uncomfortable to have on your back pocket so you might have to get used to having it on your front pocket. Not a big deal for me but it might be a big turn off for others.

No headphone jack: I'm still trying to get used to this! My biggest disappointment is that I sometimes forget to bring my adapter with me when I'm traveling and I find myself having to listen to the radio because my phone no longer has a regular headphone jack. (I recently purchase the wireless beats and would be reviewing it shortly)

Random crashes: This might just be my iPhone but once in a while (maybe once or twice a month) my iPhone will freeze and it won't let me do anything for a few seconds. I will be bringing it to the store soon and I will be updating my review, hopefully is just mine.

Overall the screen, the battery, the design, iOS itself and the camera would make me buy this iPhone over again. From my personal opinion there are way more pros than cons for me to go with this beast!

I really hope this review helps you decide!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Very good
Iphone 7 Plus,"I didn't purchase my 7 Plus through Amazon. With that being said if you choose to do so make sure it is SOLD BY AMAZON. Many reviews state it was opened or its a ""Korean"" model. You will possibly be tossing away $1,100 if you purchase outside of Amazon on their site.
The 7 Plus itself is faster with a better camera than my 6S Plus and I spent the extra $100 for the 256 GB model compared to the 128 GB. But if you have a 6S Plus and can wait for the iPhone 8, do it.
Additionally, there is a disclaimer from Apple on the Jet Black model only. It states the Jet Black color (only) is extremely susceptible to scratches due to the coating process used. I can verify it will scratch even when wiped with a micro fiber cloth. It's a beautiful color/shade but what good is it if it must be covered up to protect it?"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. An Awesome phone
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. espectacular
Iphone 7 Plus,"Delivered ahead of time, no issues. Good job. Thank you so much."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Apple made a phone to break this time I had it 2 days and screen broke and I took into apple and they want $130 to fix it never broken a screen ever and take really good care of phone just a crap screen there where 2 other people in there for screen replacement as well so beware
"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. It is great !!!
Iphone 7 Plus,Four Stars. This phone is awesome. It met all expectation. Defintely a recommendation to purchase. The price however is too high.
Iphone 7 Plus,Product was fair- good range. It was not Like-New condition. There were lots of screen scratches as well as the cuffs of the iphone has been compromised. Product was fair- good range.
Iphone 7 Plus,Excellent. I really like this! it's a dream come true!
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Very nice
Iphone 7 Plus,"Don't bother. I have been a fervent Samsung fan since the S4 but I finally got fed up with the appalling battery life on the S6 that I still have. As with all expensive phones I am careful - screen protector and case go on at the same time the phone comes out of the box. I made the jump to Apple because my family all have them and I travel abroad so much - making it easier to communicate within the iMessage environment.

I have been using WhatsApp for years and thought the transition of transferring my messages from the backup would be easy. NO WAY. The only way to do it is to pay for third party software to get all your old messages transferred across. No big deal - just another $20.

Then when the phone falls on the floor flat from a coffee table (about a foot tall) I paid no attention at the time. Later in the day I see that the screen is cracked! Seriously? After 2 weeks! I have dropped many of the Samsung phones over the years from higher places and awkward angles and the worst I have had is to change the screen protector. But nope this is a goner already. What happened to Cornings glass and all that good stuff? Have I bought a fake phone or is the build quality really that poor? For over $1000 I expect more but sadly I am not in the US at the moment. I am disgusted and obviously regret this purchase.

**Update** Sadly the story gets worse. The crack has turned out to be water damage so even with insurance that is now another $100 to replace the phone! Water resistant does not mean water proof - well I know that but it is supposed to resist being wet in my pocket during a rain shower, right? Well apparently not. So honestly after watching videos of people sticking this phone into 1.5m of water for 30 minutes I am even more dumbfounded. Why bother labelling it water resistant at all - just keep the damn phone dry like before. One day they will have a waterproof phone - oh yes they already exist but not at Apple."
Iphone 7 Plus,FINE SMARTPHONE BUT APPLE NEEDS A NEW SETVE JOBS TO RE-LAUNCH SOME OUTSTANDING IDEAS AGAIN
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Best phone I have had

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. A work of art for a machine
Iphone 7 Plus,More of the same and for a very high price...
Iphone 7 Plus,"Not worth it. Getting to saying goodbye. There are some very detailed excellent reviews of this phone already. I think the simple truth now is that Apple is not spending the time and money to be cutting edge anymore. Their price relies on the eco-system of iPad, Macbook, iPhone. The weakness in this scheme is that when these other components of the eco-system start failing (such as the Macbook Air quality/reliabilitycharging problems, then at some point it becomes less hassle to buy products at half (or much less than half) and replace them if they have problems. A Kindle Fire for 79 dollars is more easily replaced than a $750 iPad. Apple has become far too greedy. First they maximized what they take out of your pocket, now they go to the next phase of profit maximization, minimizing what they put into your pocket."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. great product, great price"

Iphone 7 Plus,"Fast delivery. iPhone arrive at the time completely new , but box was open , I mean It came with an plastic cover like the new one from apple but it was obviously open previously because inside the phone there was a SIM card , I was not surprised because I read that before in the other comments , yesterday my phone was inhibited for minutes , ive read thats normal un iPhone 7 plus , so Im happy for the Fast delivery but kinda worry for the product"

Iphone 7 Plus,"Review from an iPhone 7 plus owner. The phone its self is great, but it has some improvement that need to be made such as the dongle they give you to use 3.5mm jack headphones constantly makes buzzing sounds. The phone also has some weird little bugs in the software such as one time I couldn't adjust the brightness so I had to power the phone off and then on and then it was fixed, another time the phone was stuck in landscape view and I had to power cycle it to get back to portrait view."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. It's was good , thank you"
Iphone 7 Plus,DO NOT BUY!! The phone lags and heats up for no reason.... I dont think the phone is smart enough to handle the fastest processor on the market! Sorry and it's waaayy too overpriced..... If I'm going g to pay this much I might as well purchase the Pixel Xl
Iphone 7 Plus,Excellent
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. good.
Iphone 7 Plus,"I bought this phone hoping it was unlocked because I rather like my boost service, and long behold it wasn't unlocked this phone only works with either T-Mobile or Verizon nothing else. But I did end up changing my plan to T-Mobile I'm paying the same amount with not that great of service but I guess boost doesn't work with the 7 plus yet so ill have to wait. but my phone was not opened or anything like that. other then the service s*** I'm very pleased with my phone"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Super item
Iphone 7 Plus,"I had a horrible experience with receiving this item on time. Secondly, after it arrived, I noticed it was missing a needle like stuff that is supposed to be used to open the SIM card slot"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Just perfect!
Iphone 7 Plus,One Star. Bad.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. No problems, very satisfied"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Extremely poor quality of Jet Black Finish.

I loved it when I took it out of the box. And immediately applied Ringke Fusion Silicon Case on it at back and Zagg screen protector at the front.

However after 7 days when I removed the silicon case, I found several small abrasion dots which are permanent and I couldn't remove them by all means. The disappointing thing is that I never used it without a case then how those dots appeared only in a week and that the quality of Jet black finish is that much low that the dots appeared even in the presence of silicon case produced by well known company...

Never get a Jet black color"
Iphone 7 Plus,Love it. Mine is in the Rose Gold and a 256. I didn't order from Amazon I purchased directly from Apple. It shipped directly to me from China ahead of the scheduled date and I've been using it for over 2 months now. Days after it arrived I took it with me to Disney in Ca. My pictures came out amazing. I replaced the 6plus s which I liked but the 7 seems a little lighter and my battery does last longer. It's supper fast. At first I hated that I didn't get BT ear buds (I thought it would come with the phone) instead I got the old wired ones with a dongle to attach. I was concerned my phone would die while using the earbuds and I would have a situation of having to choose between charging and listening. Hasn't happened yet. The 7plus had good batter life and that says a lot being I'm a person who always needs my desktop on bright. Overall I'm very pleased.
Iphone 7 Plus,"Excellent and fast shipping.

The only concerns is headphones not coming without original ones.

I was waiting for AIRPODS phones"

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Excelente.
Iphone 7 Plus,"The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus at first glance don’t look all too different from their predecessors. In fact they are physically identical except for: The home button on the front, the camera in the back, and of course the missing headphone jack at the bottom. The new iPhones are IP67 dust and water resistant so they can take a splash or accidental drops in the toilet which I won't demonstrate and will take Apples word for it!

Other than that, everything else is practically the same. The basic design scheme, layout of the buttons, and the screen sizes are still 4.7 and 5.5 inches. Anyone looking for a complete redesign, well maybe next year. Sure we get black and Jet Black colors but that's not as big a deal as apple made it to be on their key note.

I decided to go with the matte black, or just simply the black color because I like black phones, and the Jet Black looked like it could scratch and smudge way too easily.

There is a welcome change in the weight. This year's iPhones are slightly lighter than the previous generations and they house a higher capacity battery that will give you an extra hour on both devices.

Now the big differences from the 6S and 7 are almost all internal. The iPhone 7 and 7 plus new feature the new A10 chip which is of course much faster than its predecessor. There's also more RAM added, the 7 has 2GB and the Plus has 3GB. the smaller sized iPhone now comes equipped with OIS in the camera so that's no longer a unique Plus feature.

What makes the Plus unique however is the extra 55mm camera for 2X optical zoom and bokeh effects. Which we will get into later.

How well does the new home button work? Well it was weird at first. When I tried it out at the apple store when these were on display, I hated it. The force touch effect was nowhere near as real as the force touch on the MacBooks which feels like an actual click. However after a few days use, I got used to it and it.

As for the missing headphone jack, this omission obviously didn’t make any sense and Apple’s courage explanation still remains one of the greatest mysteries of life. There was no real benefit to the device in removing it and adds a minor inconvenience having to carry an extra dongle.

As it turns out… it isn’t so bad. My solution is to leave that dongle on your favorite pair of headphones… or if you’ve already switched to bluetooth, then it doesn’t really matter. However, times when you want to top of your battery while listening to your music especially in a flight, you’’re either s*** out of luck or you need to invest in another adapter that supports both lightning and the headphone jack creating more first world problems!

Battery Life on the iPhone 7 Plus is on the above average side and you can pretty much get all day use out of this. I usually have my phone unplugged in the morning, use it for work, make calls, send emails, social media stuff, watch netflix while working out, and then by 9:30PM, I have 32% battery left.

As for the camera, just like every year it gets better every time. Now how much better is the question. As Phil Schiller mentioned in the iPhone Keynote, the smartphone or in this case the iPhone is the best and only camera most people will ever own. The 12 megapixel camera on the iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t disappoint, it launches fast, focuses quickly and takes great photos.

On the Plus, you get that extra 55mm lens that gives you the 2X optical zoom as well as giving you the depth effect (or bokeh) after the recent 10.1 iOS update. Front facing camera has been upgraded from 5MP to 7MP so you can now take even better selfies.

Another nice addition to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the inclusion of stereo speakers. It’s a little weird how this is set up but it sort of makes sense. You have one speaker located at the earpiece, and another located at the usual spit at the bottom of the phone. They can’t replace high quality stereo speakers but they sound decent enough.

Performance on the iPhone 7 is just incredible. It is faster than any smartphone out there, which is the trade off of Apple's tight grip on the software and navigating through the UI, launching apps, and running them is where the iPhone shines. Sure you get a few hiccups on some third party apps but they are almost always constantly updated.

I'd do a comparison with other phones but again, I turned in my fire hazard note 7 and am waiting for the google pixel. We will just have to wait and see how the pixel or 821 based devices compete against the iPhone.

But is it significantly faster than the iPhone 6S? In real world usage, you will probably have a hard time finding the difference. However, if you are coming from an iPhone 6 or older, then I would totally recommend the upgrade.

And to state the obvious, it is the best iPhone you can get. As for the best smartphone… well that’s for you to decide."
Iphone 7 Plus,"One Star. I have many problems, the phone did not come unlocked and I'm in Venezuela"

Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great new IPhone Im happy
Iphone 7 Plus,"The best iPhone ever. The iPhone 7 (Plus) is by far the best iPhone ever created, possibly the best phone ever created. However, because it is similar to previous iPhones, I will try to focus on whats new and whats so great about it. First the processor, its amazing, but so is the processor in just about every phone now a days. But considering this phone is more powerful then any MacBook or MacBook Air, or Even iPad ever created, its pretty remarkable.

Second, and this is probably the biggest, and greatest thing about this phone, is the camera, or should I say cameras. The iPhone 7 (Plus) hands down features the best camera on a phone I have ever seen. It is really fast to focus and to fire, and images are sharp and extremely color accurate. In fact, after putting this camera through its paces, I questioned why I even owned my Canon EOS 5D Mark III. But then I remembered, BOKEH. IOS 10.1 (which I beta tested) bring ""Portrait Mode"" which works, however not always. Also its not as good as a fast lens on my full-frame body, but there is definitely room to improve the portrait mode blurred effect. Overall this is a great camera.

One of the last great things about this phone is the display. When I first placed my order, I wondered if the display would live up to the claims. Wider-color gamut, 25% brighter. Well it definitely does. This is honestly one of the most color accurate displays I have ever seen, and boy does it get bright when it needs to.

Finally the added 256GB storage option is much appreciated, as I am a storage hog. Also I absolutely love the Jet Black color. this reminds of my first iPhone, the iPhone 3G. There are some negatives to this phone however, it definitely ""Hisses"" for one. However unless my phone is to the Apple Logo on the phone, I can not hear it. Also, the display is slightly (very slightly) more yellow then the iPhone 6s. However after using, I pulled out my iPhone 6s Plus, and though my iPhone 6s plus display was actually more yellow.

If the small hiccups bother you, return it and get a new one, or go to the genus bar for a replacement. Other wise, sit back, and enjoy the best phone ever created.

I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus 256GB Jet Black T-Mobile through Apples website at launch."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. I relay in love with this one
Iphone 7 Plus,"Five Stars. good. i bought this phone and its working good
but i dont know i got a Verizon sim inside the phone . my phone is unlocked ."
Iphone 7 Plus,"The fastest phone money can buy. Switched from the Note 7 to the iPhone 7 plus and I'm so happy that I did. I'm loving using iOS and the camera is definitely better than my Note 7 was. The addition to iPhones of water and dust resistance are huge for me and the main reason I never tried an iPhone before, IP67 is almost a necessity for my lifestyle and my job. Also the build quality and design of this phone is just beautiful. It may not be bezelless like my Note was but it's a better looking and better feeling device. Button placement for the sleep/wake button could've been abit lower is my only complaint. Switching from Android to iOS is huge change and I like things from both. You can't beat the customizability of Android but iOS is faster and seemly more intuitive and well thought out. Also iOS is much ""cleaner"" looking and the keyboard and touch screen I find better. Jumping from 1440p to 1080p is literally not noticeable because the colors and sharpness of the iPhone 7 plus are much better. I actually prefer this screen over my notes and I really didn't expect that. I do miss the spen and the headphone jack but I've been wanting to switch to using Bluetooth headphones at home as well as work so now I'll buy a pair for use around the house. Overall the iPhone 7 plus is an amazing and beautiful device that surely isn't a huge change from its predecessors but a wonderful refinement. The addition of IP67 water and dust resistant and the major improvement of the camera to put it on par with if not THE best camera right now. Only the pixel xl and Note 7 are competing. The increase in performance with the A10 fusion chip also makes this by far the fastest device I've ever used, I have yet to experience any lag. If you want the FASTEST phone you can't get one faster than the large storage iPhone 7 and 7 plus. (Reports have shown that the 128gb and 256gb models are much faster than the 32gb models due to technicality of current storage manufacturing). I can't recommend the iPhone 7 plus more and that is coming from a top tier android device and using android for the past 4 years. Solid job here Apple, for me this is a perfect device."
Iphone 7 Plus,"I can't use it, the phone only can use AT&T and T-mobile. My phone is Verizon. I am so mad at it"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Stunning Black phone! Best product ever from Apple. Nothing much to say about the product, as reviews are available.

One thing I noticed different was the small pin to pull out the SIM card is not available with the package. So once you pull out the stunning phone and get impatient to begin to use, you have to run around to search for a paper clip to do the job of that missing clip!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Awesome phone delivered before time
Iphone 7 Plus,"iPhone 7 pPlus Jet Black 128gb. I have upgraded from an iPhone 6 plus to a iPhone 7 plus with hesitation. I was very happy with the 6 plus and was considering sticking it out for the iPhone 7S plus to be released. I mean, Apple introduced another phone that looked pretty much like the past two releases and I did not like that they took the ear jack out. However, the water resistance sold me. This was something that I felt would keep my phone safe when using outside in the elements. I also was very excited about the camera was getting rave reviews. So I counted the pennies and did the plunge. I opted on the Pre-Order with US Cellular picking the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb. As everyone knows, the Jet Black was a back order nightmare and I waited 4 weeks for it to arrival. I picked Jet Black though because it was a different look for Apple that I thought would appease my desire in change. I was warned up front about the coating being easily scratched so I had a case waiting for it when it arrived. Three days ago, it finally arrived! I immediately placed it in the case to keep the scuffs off the finish. But I have to confess that I have removed the case a few times just to admire the finish – It is gorgeiPhone 7 Plus Jet Black 128gbous!!! The black finish has such an appeal to me that suggests elegance. Now let’s talk nuts and bolts. The processor is zippy! I could see a difference from the get-go on the speed of opening apps and doing functions on the 7. I never considered the 6 plus a snail but in comparison….. I’d take the 7 any day! The camera is dynamic! I have found it so flexible to move from up close to far distant shots. Really nice far distant shots! The 6 plus had a decent camera but the zoom on the 7 is a whole new league. I really like the live picture feature on the camera as well. For those who have not experienced it, You snap a photo and it records a mini video of the second before the shot, second during the shot, and a second after the shot. So you can see the action leading up to the photo you had taken. This is done by pressing on the photo while viewing it. Its good for those viewing the photo to have another understanding what was going on when the photo was taken. Another improvement is the voice mail to text. Say you are in a meeting and a notification pops up that you have a voice mail. It would be disruptive to check the voice mail to hear the message left. With the 7, it prints the voice mail out under the play button. This is not merely a iPhone 7 improvement but can only be done on the 6, 6s and 7. Nice! So All in all, I am very happy with the iPhone 7 plus. I highly recommend the phone and can’t wait to see what the 7s Plus has to offer."
Iphone 7 Plus,"256GB iPhone 7 Plus in Rose Gold. The advantages are the dual camera that has a 12 megapixels with 7 megapixels for the second camera with DSLR quality, which enhances the colors and quality, has 2x the optical zoom and records 4k videos. It has the A10 fusion processor which enhances its performance and balances the battery consumption. The retina HD display with 3D touch that allows users to press the pressure sensitive display that allows you to access shortcuts faster. Water resistant of IP67, meaning up to 1 meter. The storage size of 32 GB, 128 GB, or 256GB.
The disadvantages are not having a headphone jack. You would have the use the lightning connector/adapter or buy wireless headphones. The price is outrageous.
Personally, my whole family is on team iPhone. The iPhone is great because I had a major upgrade (from the 5S). It is better than any previous iPhone models."
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Good
Iphone 7 Plus,"Not sealed and Factory unlocked. it's a Verizon phone. Just be aware before you think about to buy it. It's not Brand New or sealed and nor a factory unlocked phone. I found a verizon sim card inside the phone and it doesn't support t-mobile, lyca mobile, and altra mobile. I was excited about this new phone but it's just destroyed my excitement in a minute.I never expected anything like that from Amazon."
Iphone 7 Plus,"not all phones here support GSM and CDMA. phone from Applehome only supports GSM brand. But article online says ""unlocked models support both CDMA and GSM bands"". This was not clear until purchase. Be careful."
Iphone 7 Plus,Nice and Powerfull. I was full of doubts with this phone. Since have me been apple customer products for more than 15 years and for the first time i feel there was no difrence between the plus 6 . But now i have had some time with the phone using the beta 3 IOS and there is some good stuff. The camera just incredible it is beast . The nice black color looks asewome . The new home button it's different more kind of android phone. And finally the speed wow i think it is faster that my macbook air 13 inch latest model .
Iphone 7 Plus,Very good. Nice job!
Iphone 7 Plus,"Awesome phone and highly recommend it to anyone. Arrived before time, and as described!
Awesome phone and highly recommend it to anyone!!"
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Great as described
Iphone 7 Plus,This is the ultimate iPhone I have the regular iPhone 7 but this is way superior in every way
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. Excellent.
Iphone 7 Plus,the iPhone box was opened and has some finger prints on the screen . Also bad packaging.
Iphone 7 Plus,Expected more!. I get a new iPhone every year. This one is disappointing. Yes there are important internal improvements but considering the price Apple should have done more. Hopefully the new Google Pixel will be a significant competitor and drive the marketplace to greater heights. So far no one has offered the personal service of Apple. If google does that they will take a major share of Apple's market. I am willing to switch only if they offer me the service. The pixel looks first class.
Iphone 7 Plus,Amazing. I was a bit scepticle about the phone being unlocked but I must say it is 400% unlocked. I don't live in an area with at&t n those kind of big time companies I live in the Caribbean with local phone companies and it works perfectly . I'm very very very happy with my purchase. Bought from seller raydes he is amazing
Iphone 7 Plus,"Love it and I am an actual user that is moving from the Galaxy S7 Edge. Not going to do a crazy long review. Just wanted to touch on some things. First off, the phone is just great (I am not focusing on some stupid cost of part BS someone else did, but rather actual use). I still have the S7 Edge but will be selling it. The battery life on the Edge was not that great to me and I tried everything to get it to be better. The iPhone 7 Plus battery life has been so much better. My S7 was usually at 62% when I got home for lunch where as my iPhone 7 Plus is at 87% (same usage..well maybe a little more for the iPhone 7 since it is still fairly new to me). This is roughly 6 hours of being off the charger and I use it at work a lot for pictures, slo-mo video of equipment and exchange email/texting.
The speed of the iPhone 7 Plus is also top notch. Considerably faster than my S7 Edge and also my friends iPhone 6 (not 6S). The camera or dual cameras work great as did the Galaxy S7 edge. I do like the 4K video better on the iPhone 7 though and the few low light shots I took were amazingly good.
So what about the headphone jack (or lack there of). This was something I was worried about at first. I have a very nice set of quad driver headphones that I use daily at the track. I wasn't about to invest in another set of headphones and give these up. When I found out they were including the adapter I said ""What the hell..I will give it a try"". The adapter is very flexible which is a good thing. The connection to the lightning port is solid and using it with my headphones was no issue at all. Actually I don't know this for a fact, but I questioned whether that port is supplying more power to them. Quad drivers need decent power (for the most part) to get sound volume and good quality. The S7 Edge sucked for this. The iPhone 7 Plus allowed me the highest volume yet and the audio quality at that high volume was right on. Again, I don't know if the phone is just pushing more power to them, but it is distinctly better.
I am not going to go on and on about this phone, but pretty much all other items. The new home button, pressure sensitive screen (although I know this isn't the first iPhone to have that), stereo speakers etc are just done extremely well.
The OS? Well I was a super moderator in an Android forum and know all the arguments both ways. I will say that the integration with all apps on iOS is just much more fluid. Sure, you do have some limitations, but when it works so well, why does that really matter?
I do have to ask some iPhone regulars. Has Apple made a lot of changes to their keyboard over the past couple of years? I just find the typing on this phone to be extremely accurate and it just feels right. As a matter of fact, I just went to take the proof picture and typed on the Edge for the first time since getting the iPhone. Not fun at all!!!

Call me a Apple Sheep or whatever you want, but I assure you I am not a die hard of any system. The iPhone 7 Plus combined with iOS 10 is just plain out superior to anything else out there!! IMHO

For the record I have the iPhone 7 Plus 128GB in Black (not jet black). I also have the Apple leather cover on it which works very well.

On a side note....iOS 10 messaging is a fricken blast!!! If you just installed iOS 10 and have not watched a Youtube video to learn all the new features you need to do it. And...if you own an older iPhone and you are not able to long press on the send arrow to get to more features, go to settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Make sure Reduce motion is set to OFF. Then you will be able to get to things like invisible ink, fireworks, etc.

Pictures are only to prove I own both. Not meant to show what anything looks like since they are low grade photos.

Enjoy"
Iphone 7 Plus,"The new home button only works with bare hands, etip & rubber gloves wont work. I HAVE TO TOUCH THE HOME BUTTON W/BARE HANDS

This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone. No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves. None of them work with my phone. So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind. Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold! I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone.

SOLUTION

I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:

Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on.

This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot. Then to unlock your iPhone 7:

1. Press the sleep button on the right of the phone.
2. Press the Assistive Touch dot.
3. Touch the home button.
4. Enter your SIX digit pass code.

Okay, so now I feel better, but I still want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into ALL THE EXTRA STEPS each time you want to open the phone.

OTHER CONS

1. I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard. It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5. Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen. I have tried it on every sensitivity level.
2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works. Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over.

I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects."
Iphone 7 Plus,"The phone is normally brand new, nothing special. But I have required for original receipt twice, and seller can't even provide any proof of the purchase of this iPhone."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Disappointing. Slow. Worse reception than the 6. AT&T says the iPhone 7 can't handle multiple apps running at the same time or else it will switch to 4G instead of their LTE network. So compared to my iPhone 6, I have to now keep closing out all the other apps that may be running in order to get the one I'm using currently to work correctly. I haven't actually tried this....but we'll see. I'm leaning towards them not really knowing what they're talking about.

Apple claims the battery lasts much better. I'm not sure I can notice a difference between the 6 and the 7 in the longevity of the battery. I guess I can only say I'm happy it didn't get worse.

The processor seems slow. I was looking forward to these fast speeds that eliminating the headphone port was supposed to alllow. Again, I don't seem to notice any improvement over the 6. In fact I almost feel like my 6 is faster than the 7.

At the moment, I'm a little underwhelmed by my the new phone. It looks the same..but performs worse. I only upgraded because AT&T had a promotion that got me a free phone if I exchanged my 6 for it.

I got in a pool with my iPhone 6..hopefully the 7 will prevent me from killing my phone that way again."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Improvements over the iPhone 6+!! The iPhone 7 Plus offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S Plus. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note.

- Better display (wider colour gamut)
- Better taptic engine
- 4 grams lighter
- IP67 Water and dust resistance
- Way better A10 Fusion CPU
- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p)
- Rear wide angle lens have OIS, telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS. Bummer!
- Better low light performance
- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE
- Slightly better battery life
- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)

The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S plus after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note.

The telephoto lens does NOT have any OIS which is disappointing. Images taken on the sensor usually underperforms, especially in low light conditions due to its smaller aperture size. Pictures taken on the telephoto lens is also usually slightly blurred.

People also reported on the hissing issues on the 7 Plus model specifically that can be captured when recording video/audio when the CPU/GPU is under load. Not all phones have this problem and for me, I just can hear a slight humming sound coming from the phone.

Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!"
Iphone 7 Plus,"Phone is great. It is brand new and sealed. Phone is great. It is brand new and sealed, but it does not have any great difference with IPhone 6s lol."
Iphone 7 Plus,"Some improvements, but doesn't blow me away anymore at this price! This iPhone does not bring very significant changes to the 6S Plus. This time round I bought this phone from Apple with AppleCare so that I can change it out for a new one next year when Apple launches a redesigned iPhone - it's rumored they will do a full redesign for the 10th anniversary. However, it is a bit too expensive as most carriers have now dropped the discounts they used to offer on new iPhones.

I justified the exorbitant price given that I use my phone for at least eight hours a day, and not only text, call, tweet, Instagram or email but also read business documents and books and watch TV so I bit the bullet and got it on the installment plan. (It's 0% interest, and allows to exchange the phone next year, or you can pay 24 interest free installments and keep the phone, if you switch out then the cycle of 24 months begins again.)

What I love about this iPhone 7 Plus so far:
- Blazing fast, a performance improvement from 6S Plus, top-heavy apps download in seconds
-256 GB is great, I hated having to delete pictures off all the time so that I could take some more
- Black (matte) is great for viewing videos, screen is sharper and shows such great detail, it's amazing. If you're streaming HD you'll be blown away at the difference between HD movies on 6 Plus and 7Plus - you can see film quality detail, it's great. A higher resolution screen now shows pics in great detail. There is a Zoom setting that you can enable when you're setting up the phone as the sharper screen has made the letters finer, and more can fit on the screen.
- Home button is now Taptic feedback and it's very easy to get used to the new format. So a light touch on the home button now produces a knock from inside, like an Android rather than having to depress the button. This has helped me immensely as I used to press too hard earlier and bring up Siri all the time, it could be very disconcerting in a meeting.
- The lag for TouchID is reduced, this is important as I use it not only for opening the phone but for Apple Pay, Visa checkout and use TouchID for all my bank logins. Much safer on unsecured networks, I hope.
- Dual Speakers make it easier to watch videos with no headphones as it's louder
- EarPods seem to sound better, but they're still uncomfortable in my ears after 30 minutes. The lightning connector Headphones work on all my previous iOS devices. It's nice that Apple gave the little accessory to connect mono audio jack but what's with the tiny stuff. I'm so mystified since the tiny attachments of Apple Pencil!
- And finally the Dual camera- it takes really sharp pictures much sharper than my iPhone 6 Plus up to the 2X magnification. The lowlight performance is also better. I am waiting for the next iOS 10.1 update to really see the ability of the portrait mode that was showcased during the launch keynote. It's also better for low light and pets as I'm getting sharper images of my dog who cannot sit still even for a second. However, I took my selfie and since this camera is so improved, I'm getting almost DSLR quality results. Now I can actually do my makeup with the selfie camera on! The flash is also now metered to 3 different levels rather than one.
- Water resistant - although my 6S also survived a few seconds in a river- I expect more from 7 Plus.
- And one more thing, the 7 Plus is rumored to have extra RAM (2GB?) and that makes it really, really fast. The webpages are up in an instant - the movies stream with no jitters, no more tapping my feet while waiting for something to load like with 6 Plus! Some apps can't handle the improvements, and I see weird crashes but I am sure the developers of those apps will fix it soon.

Some stuff has improved due to iOS10 - love the new messaging enhancements, new Home app, the enhancements in the Health app, force touch is now better than ever, some keyboards have been added and I'm loving the Hinglish keyboard.

What I don't like:
-Not a major redesign. Yes there is better speed, a better camera, a better screen but not a major change from 6S Plus, but for me it's way more expensive as the carrier discounts are gone. To get a big discount I have to turn in my old phone, and get locked into a 2 year contract with a 30 month installment plan, no way!
- I'm ready for no audio jack, as I mainly use Bluetooth headphones but I would have to carry this tiny accessory around for my Bose headphones that I like using. I hope some accessory manufacturers come up with something smarter.
- I can't charge and listen to the music at the same time as both use lightning connector, this is crazy as I use this feature a lot at work as my Bluetooth headphones sometimes can't sync properly with YouTube audio. If anyone knows a fix please post in comments.
- There has been no redesign of the iPhone charger plug or the lightning cord! By this time I expected a better cord that doesn't break easily, or wireless charging that actually works, and a charger that is more compact or at least charges 3X times faster like some newly designed Android chargers
- The phone is still a little too big for my grip with a protective case on it, I really wish they had improved on the screen to bezel ratio. The bezel needs to disappear.

Overall it's still a nice phone, and it's better than the previous version, but I expect something more revolutionary from Apple. This was more of an enhancement than complete innovation."
Iphone 7 Plus,overpriced. overpriced. costs apple $200.
Iphone 7 Plus,Five Stars. k lol
Iphone xr,"Impressed.The phone is speedy, and the battery life is excellent (mostly LTE connections during the day; at night, Verizon service at my house is awful and the phone runs over WiFi calling... now, this has no bearing on the phone itself, but this is the basis of my battery life comments.) I love the screen. "
Iphone xr,"Great Phone at a ""Reasonable"" Price. the XS has better technology in the screen and the dual lens system, but this phone (the XR) has an awesome screen that looks great, the camera is sensational (for a smartphone), and the additional screen real estate given the removal of the home button and the bezel-to-bezel screen is awesome. The phone is actually just a hair smaller than the 7+ we replaced and the screen is significantly larger. The phone is fast, face ID works well, and we are overall very pleased with this phone. If you love your Apple devices (or, more specifically, mobile devices that run iOS), prefer a large screen with newer technology, but do not want to pay a premium price, this is probably the best phone for you. You also have a choice of colors, which is pretty cool!"
Iphone xr,Camera technology is poor quality. The cameras were great and the screen was ideal for traveling. The battery life is incredible. The speaker sound is loud and crisp. Had no issues with Bluetooth connectivity to my vehicle. The issue I just couldn’t get past was the camera technology. The zoom on the back camera is truly disappointing. Apple should not have released this phone with this camera technology. The front camera during FaceTime calls is grainy and so is the picture you view of the person you are talking to. Just had my carrier issue me a return label. I would not recommend to a friend.
Iphone xr,"Good solid phone. Phone is beautiful but the only downside is that it’s glass front and back therefore you want a case.
"
Iphone xr,"Love it. Both of my step kids loves their new Apple iPhone XR, it's a big step up from the Apple iPhone 6s!!!"
Iphone xr,"Works perfectly. This phone is wonderful, large screen, great camera, crystal clear, couldn’t ask for better!!"
Iphone xr,"Great phone. Five stars for this phone. Very fast, tough, and much better upgrades from previous versions"
Iphone xr,Great phone. I like the extra security function where no one can see your texts on screen if it’s locked
Iphone xr,iPhone XR does not disappoint. The iPhone XR is a great phone at an affordable price. NO need to pay up for the iPhone XS.
Iphone xr,Kid approved. We allowed our kids to upgrade from the 6S to the XR and they both said that they love it!!!
Iphone xr,Great IPhone. This is the best IPhone I’ve had to date. I love the full screen and also the thin style.
Iphone xr,Works great. Lots to learn. So far so good. I love Iphones. The service at Best Buy was excellent. I
Iphone xr,"Great iPhone for my wife, I got one also, can’t let her have all of the fun"
Iphone xr,Not as clear as my other iPhone. I will make it work. I like the face recognition. I do like the picture features.
Iphone xr,
Iphone xr,Great phone. I really like the new XR. Upgraded from the Galaxy S8 and couldn’t be happier.
Iphone xr,MUCH FASTER. THIS WAS A BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM MY IPHONE 6. MUCH FASTER AND MANY MORE FEATURES.
Iphone xr,Was new and came with the newest chip. This phone had the latest chip in it and was also on sale so is a great deal.
Iphone xr,Great phone. Best IPhone yet great camera as always but the battery life is the real deal
Iphone xr,"Nice phone. Great phone, my son loves it! It’s got more features than the older models"
Iphone xr,Great camera. So far ao good. Excellent picture quality and processes at the speed of light
Iphone xr,R iphone. Great camera facial recognition is fast... just a bit heavier than expected
Iphone xr,"Love this phone. Absolutely love this phone, great battery life and great screen quality"
Iphone xr,Easy to use. Just got my new I phone and so far it’s features are great and easy to use
Iphone xr,Good phone. This truly is a good looking and functioning phone!! I love iPhones though
Iphone xr,Best. This is a great phone for our 12 year old who loves to play games.
Iphone xr,Great Phone. I love my new phone. Apple did it again! The camera is awesome.
Iphone xr,"Great phone! Great economical phone! Fast, beautiful phone. Got two of them!"
Iphone xr,Good iphone. Although overpriced this is a good phone. It's way too large.
Iphone xr,"Great phone, very functional. The phone is everything you want, one issue is it is to heavy."
Iphone xr,Quick. Much faster than my 7+. Received no return box for old phone.
Iphone xr,"Amazing. Works Great, Very User friendly , Great Screen and Camera"
Iphone xr,Perfect Upgrade. Nice upgrade from the iPhone 6. Beautiful display and fast.
Iphone xr,Love this. Cheap alternative to an expensive charger. Highly recommend
Iphone xr,"great. My love's her new phone, we always love apple products."
Iphone xr,Love it. I like the phone. Great camera. Easy to use. Great color
Iphone xr,iphone xr 64 g. husband went from flip phone to this getting used to it
Iphone xr,"love it. of course love my phone, i love all apple products."
Iphone xr,Great phone. The iPhone XR is very streamlined and easy to learn.
Iphone xr,Great phone. Love the size. Great camera. Quick internet speed.
Iphone xr,Great phone. Love it!! This phone is very easy to use!!!!!!!!!!
Iphone xr,"Great iPhone. Fast, fast new iPhone Xr, just try it for yourself"
Iphone xr,Iphone XR. If new to iPhones this one is a very user friendly
Iphone xr,"Upgraded from 7+ Good Move. I had a 7+ and upgraded to the XR. So far so good. I’ve had it a week and battery life is great, screen size is great. It took about 2 days to get completely used to no longer having a home button, but now it’s no big deal. 

I really like swiping left/right at the bottom of the screen for recently used apps instead of double tapping the home button on my 7+. Also, and this is a big plus for me, this phone has a bigger screen but feels much smaller in my pocket. I have a case on it and it feels like my 7+ did in my pocket without a case. I sometimes go looking for my XR because I can’t tell it’s actually in my pocket. 

That’s a nice upgrade.

Also, the camera on this phone is amazing. I was worried going from the dual camera on the 7+ to a single camera but I have no regrets. I’m not a professional photographer by any means but I can spot a good picture and I have to say the camera on the XR is really good. Low light is no problem, colors are still very bright."
Iphone xr,"Great phone upgrade. I love this new iPhone XR 128 GB in white. For the past five years, I had been using the iPhone 5s. We looked at models from the 7 to XS, but never felt excited enough to get one. When the XR was released, I was excited for such a nice phone at a good price. 

The phone feels fast, takes great pictures and videos, and has a nice fit in my hands. FaceID seems to work pretty well. And the battery life has been outstanding. I was just at a national park for a week, and only had to recharge every other day. 

Based on my experience thus far, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade from an iPhone 5 to 8, or anyone who doesn’t care about OLED and doesn’t need optical zoom on their phone."
Iphone xr,"Great iPhone. Every thing about this iPhone is great. I upgraded from iPhone 6 , this is a bit bigger between the Xs and Xs max . So if you don’t like a bigger phone it’s not for you. First the battery life is excellent last the whole day and next morning. The camera is really great. As for the screen resolution don’t listen to the critics it’s excellent. If you’re upgrading from an iPhone 6 through 8 you’ll won’t notice any difference. If you are using an oled display phone you will notice some but not much. And it’s not a budget iPhone the critics labeled as such not Apple. it has 90 percent of 
What the Xs Has . If you can check it out at Best Buy or your phone carrier do so"
Iphone xr,"Love My New XR. It was time for a new iPhone. I preordered the XR and picked it up a week later. I've had it just four days but so far I absolutely am loving this phone. The face id is so cool and operating the phone is very easy. It's larger then my old phone and heavier but still comfortable to hold and carry. One item worth noting is there were a few apps that were hung up showing ""loading"" because of their size they would not load without using wi fi. I decided I didn't want them and deleted them. I recommend getting a glass screen cover and a sturdy case since I understand the repair cost is incredibly expensive."
Iphone xr,"Easy to use and understand! All the great aspects of iphone put into a more flawless and easier to use phone. The commands and swipes are effortless and smooth, the graphics and screen are stunning, and the sound is beautiful. My only issue (if you can call it that) is the size. It’s significantly larger than my old iphone 6s so it’s more difficult to use one-handed but I also have small hands so this won’t be a problem for everyone. Overall it’s every bit as exciting as Apple has made it out to be!!"
Iphone xr,"I really like this phone. I had been reading about the XR for about a month or so, and thought this hit the sweet spot of having most of the functions of the more expensive XS and XS Max at a better price. Coming from a 7 Plus, I have no issue with the screen, and I never used 3D touch a lot, so I don't really miss it. I think the pictures are just fine, plus having more colors for the XR tipped the scales for me toward it."
Iphone xr,"Great phone. The big switch from android to Apple was made easy with this Xr phone - so intuitive. Best Buy did a great job of moving all my info from my old phone for free and giving me tips about the new phone. Two weeks in and I’m loving my new phone, especially “Heh, Siri,” which is great for making hands free calls while driving to anyone in my contact list. Pictures great too."
Iphone xr,"Phones are us.... Great job by Best Buy staff. They were professional, courteous, and on task. We needed an upgrade on phones and they transitioned us quickly and competently. The only time consumer was transferring info from the old phone to the new phone (which is a normal timely procedure). The update was smooth and seamless. Hats off for a job well done."
Iphone xr,"So much screen. I love the size. Great in between size from the xs and xs max. Love how quick it is. The battery lasts almost twice as long as my 7 did. That alone is worth the upgrade. Screen resolution is great and the bezel isn’t as bad as people made it sound. With a 128 gig, I have room for all the movies I want now too."
Iphone xr,great $ for an iphone. My last I phone was almost 5 yrs old & the battery was starting to go. After researching I decided on the XR as I use my phone primarily as a Phone & I am not a gamer. It was easy to transition to & the screen is larger but I am still able to carry it in my pockets. The $ was the most reasonable.
Iphone xr,Great phone. I had an iPhone 6s before and it was great but I really love this phone. I wanted to upgrade and I'm very happy that I waited for this phone. I can't get into all the technical stuff but the camera is great for the amount I use it and the battery is a huge upgrade from my 6s.
Iphone xr,"very intuitive. I have liked this phone so far. A lot of options, many I have not fully explored yet. I'm happy with the camera and especially like the screen size. The heavier device takes a bit of getting used to but well worth the trade off for amazing battery life."
Iphone xr,"XR is a great phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 7; the improvements are many. The processing speed and increase in screen size are most significant for me. Wireless charging is great too. 

Best Buy’s experienced consultants were very helpful with the sale."
Iphone xr,Awesome new iPhone. The new iPhone XR was worth the wait! The phone is amazing and it's quite a bit better priced than the Xs or XsMax. Not everyone wants to make movies with their phones and this was the highlight of the new line of iphones. It was worth the wait.
Iphone xr,Great phone for the lower price! I have a XS Max for personal use and bought this XR for business use. I’m not finding much difference between the two considering the XR is less expensive. I think the XR is a great value if you’re an Apple fan like me.
Iphone xr,"Wife loves it. I got this phone to upgrade my wife's 6S. So far she really likes it. The size is not too big, but it is bigger than the 6S. Face recognition works well. The camera is great. iOS works well and is really fast."
Iphone xr,"love the phone. I took the XR as an upgrade from my trusted 5s. It is a great upgrade. I love the facial recognition and the size. I was worried it would be bulky since I was used to the 5s, but I have enjoyed it."
Iphone xr,"Happy Wife. I upgraded my wife's iPhone SE to this larger to hold, XR. She is still getting used to not having the home button, but she admits that she does love having a larger screen."
Iphone xr,"Great iPhone! I just upgraded my iPhone 7 to the iPhone XR and I am pretty happy with it. My only complaint is that I didn’t realize this model only had portrait mode for people, but that’s on me."
Iphone xr,"upgraded new iPhone XR RED. so happy i switch from Sprint to Verizon, good deal when i did it, I got a very special deal on the day when i purchased , buy 1 and get 1 free. Also free activation."
Iphone xr,Who needs an XS? Upgraded from a 6s. Larger screen makes a difference! Not missing my 6s nor wish I had gotten a XS which is a lot more!
Iphone xr,"Purchased for my sister. I bought this phone for myself and after speaking with the Best Buy representative, decided to buy one for my sister too. She is very pleased with the purchase."
Iphone xr,So far so good. I am 70 years old and upgraded from an iPhone 5. I was concerned that I would have trouble adjusting and figuring out a newer technology. So far so good.
iphone xr,"Love my IPhone XR. I walked into Best Buy with the intention of upgrading from a 6s Plus to the 8 Plus. So glad I went with this phone! It didn’t cost much more than the 8 Plus and has so many features, which I am still learning. I didn’t realize they came out the same day as I went into the store which was just several days ago. This phone is just more affordable than the XS or XS Max.
It’s different with no home button and swiping up to get my apps and such, but really it didn’t take me long to get used to it. I just love the Face ID as well. I did use the Passcode at times on the 6s Plus, but it wasn’t always convenient to do that. Now I just look at my phone, and I can keep Face ID on all the time. Love the color blue as well, and have it in a clear case to show it off. The battery lasts longer that my old phone too, which is a big plus. I haven’t gotten into the portraits mode of the photos as yet. There is just so much to learn!"
iphone xr,"Great Phone with Some Small Issues.  My fiance is very happy with this phone, although for her it is a bit big and difficult to handle. This is not entirely due to the size but also the material being in her opinion rather slippery. This can be solved by a case, but that also adds additional heft to the phone. Although this is certainly a personal preference, comfort when using the device is important. 

For me, the screen is a bit compromised when compared to other phones at this level and the lower resolution is clear to me, but completely unrecognized by my fiance. If you are someone who doesn't easily notice differences in resolution, this may not matter to you at all. 

Overall the phone is fast and the cameras are excellent. In day to day use, my fiance is very happy with the iPhone XR.
"
iphone xr,"Solid phone without the Xs price. I moved from the iphone 6 to the XR because I did not want to pay the price of the Xs. Glad I did. The phone is easy to handle very responsive and the speed is great. I thought moving to this phone would be a big adjustment, size wise, but with the full screen Apple was able to make a bigger screen without increasing the phone size very much. Also, impressed with the camera
"
iphone xr,"Much better than I thought! Awesome phone! The bezel is barely different from the XS if you ask me. The screen resolution is awesome. That I truly believe you don’t really see a difference compared to the oled plus it’s plenty cheaper. Plus, there’s colors to choose from. This is like a neon salmon in real life. Great phone though! Speaker seams louder and battery lasts forever!
"
iphone xr,"Typical iPhone. I don't call it typical in a bad way. Typical in that it's exactly what you think the iPhone should be. I love that the screen is bigger than my 8+ but the phone is smaller. Don't miss the home button, but I do occasionally miss 3D touch. Not enough to consider knocking a star off obviously. Definitely worth the upgrade if you want some of the new tech."
iphone xr,"Good phone, but keeps turning on randomly. I clicked to review this phone and ended up incorrectly reviewing a video. Best Buy worked hard to help me with my phone, but Verizon screwed up everything on their end. The phone is good but screen sensitivity is annoying. Apple should never have omitted the fingerprint recognition on/off button like on the series 7 &8 phones, because I don't want to use facial recognition."
iphone xr,"So far, awesome. The iPhone XR is great so far. No complaints at all. The Best Buy team in Nampa is great. We’ve used them for years, and the experience has been great every time. There are a few crew members we remember over the years, but don’t remember the names exactly. We just got the apple watches too, and they are too cool. Great products, sold by people who know their stuff...."
iphone xr,"My Mom Loves it. Got this phone for my mom, she was a an android user, but loves her new phone. She’s able to use it with ease without asking me a million questions on how to do something. Screen is bigger than my Xs, but good for her as she’s able to see her screen much better. This phone is definitely user friendly."
iphone xr,"This is the most excellent phone I've owned... =). Apple, you have done it again... The new iPhone xR is simply perfection. I am in love with my new device and my entire spiritual health has increased... Seriously... Apple productsd will enhance the spirit of man, should man choose to make the correct choice... Thanks Best Buy and Apple!"
iphone xr,"Love it. Initially, I was lost without the home button. After watching the intro video, it’s all self-explanatory and works SO well. I love the size. I can see more at once. It’s slightly heavier than my 6S, but so clear and intuitive. I love it!"
iphone xr,"The newest iPhone XR. I had My husband upgrade from his 7 s and he is always apprehensive about learning a new device the staff in the mobile dept are so helpful , patient and supportive. My husband is now loving his new device. What can I say apple has done it again!"
iphone xr,"Everything I need! I replaced an iPhone 7 Plus with the Xr. Although I gave up the zoom lens, the large, clear screen in a smaller frame and the speed of the phone more than make up for the loss of the lens. Yes, it's still expensive, but you get what you pay for"
iphone xr,iPhone XR. Took some getting used to with no home button but absolutely LOVE the face recognition feature! It's a bit heavier than I thought but an absolutely incredible phone! The best one yet of the iPhones!
iphone xr,Great Phone. Upgraded from my IPhone 7 and this was a welcome suprise! Great phone and exceptional battery life. I spend 8am-8pm some days at school and work and I get home with over half my battery.
iphone xr,"Best phone i have ever owned. Waited 5 years for this. Replaced my iphone 5, well worth the wait. Only thing that takes some getting use to is the larger size. Doesn't fit in pocket like the 5."
iphone xr,6 to XR. Made the jump from a 6 to XR. Easy to maintain workflow so I didn’t have to re-learn too much. Photo quality is improved. Battery life is great. Vibrate settings were better on the 6.
iphone xr,Nice camera and battery life. XR pricing is a little better than some other new I-phones. BOGO deal is nice if adding a line. Camera and battery life is a plus with this phone. Good I-phone quality.
iphone xr,Love this phone. Love this phone! I had an iPhone 6 that was losing charge and was very annoying. You all had a special buy one get one free and it worked out great for me! It’s an awesome phone
iphone xr,Great phone. upgraded mom from iphone6s and she loves it as much as I love it. Our FaceTime is much clearer. Great budget iPhone for an older person that don't need those extras.
iphone xr,Pretty cool phone! The phone itself is pretty cool. I love how it’s all screen! The camera is really close up though. And after you take a selfie the picture is really blotchy.
iphone xr,"Like being able to increase type size for easier r. Like some of the added features for navigating between different screens or apps. Would be nice to have an instruction book to figure out some of the new features.

"
iphone xr,"Good enough to get me to switch. Well made construction and super responsive, loaded with lots of features and I love the applepay app. Vivid colors to choose from"
iphone xr,"upgraded iPhoneXR. Got a good deal in Best buy when switching from Sprint to Verizon, buy 1 and get 1 free, plus free activation. Better reception and better network than sprint."
iphone xr,"Worth it.Great phone, faster and better quality than the 6s I upgraded from. Can’t notice a difference from the Xs and this one is cheaper."
iphone xr,Excellent phone. I really like the phone compared to my old 6s. The one thing I find a little difficult is not having the home button
iphone xr,Happy kid! My son is really with his new phone. The screen size is great and the quality of the pictures is also great.
iphone xr,"Excellent. We've had these phones for 2 weeks now, and love them. As always, the Nampa Best Buy crew was awesome too."
iphone xr,Great phone for the price. The battery life of excellent and lasts longer than any previous iPhone I have had. Camera is excellent too
iphone xr,Great phone. Upgraded from iPhone 7 and love the size of the phone. The screen is great and feels like top quality
iphone xr,It's really nice. I left apple for the s9+ after a few I missed apple and this phone filled that void easily it’s great
iphone xr,Awesome phone. I needed a new I phone and after comparing phones I bought the XR and I love it. No home button. Easy to use and the camera takes extremely good pictures.
iphone xr,"Great phone. I really like the improvements when I went from my iPhone 6s to the Xr. Great battery life, excellent camera and love the facial recognition."
iphone xr,Great phone. Love this phone for its ease of us. The picture taken are clear and vibrant and the battery definitely lasts much longer than my old iPhone 6S. Very satisfied.
iphone xr,"wife's new iphone. updated my wife from 5E, she loves this phone, before she wanted small iphone, but the features and battery life of this one sold her."
iphone xr,"Great phone. I'm not one to have the latest and greatest especially when it comes to technology. However, I'm glad I made an exception this time."
iphone xr,Great. I added a line for a family member who is used to iPhones and she loves it. Her work phone is an iPhone 6 so quite an update for her.
iphone xr,"Perfect Size. It's only been a couple of weeks but so far so good. It has the perfect fit for me, I am 6'2"".

The screen is clean and crisp."
iphone xr,"Former 6s owner. This phone is a game changer. Longer battery, amazing pictures, faster processing, etc. there are bugs but I’m sure it’ll get worked out."
iphone xr,Met all expectations.
iphone xr,Great camera i-phone quality. Enjoy using the phone with the zoom camera and love the color white. Battery life is great compared to older I6
iphone xr,Everything works great. We are one week into this phone. Everything works great. It would be even better if it were a bit smaller.
iphone xr,happy with my new iPhone XR. this phone has a cool face recognition feature that makes it unique to the others. I really like it.
iphone xr,Love it. Love this phone. Great camera. Didn't notice much of a difference between this and the iphone xs.
iphone xr,LOVE IT! What is there not to like about this Phone? the Quality and color out performs the others..
iphone xr,Great phone. It’s actually a great phone and simple to use. I love how Apple does a great job with the iPhone.
iphone xr,It's an ok phone. I am not really wowed with this phone at all . But it is definitely a step up from my 6s plus .
iphone xr,"Love it. My wife loves her new Apple iPhone XR, it's a big step up from the Apple iPhone 6s!!!"
iphone xr,"Wonderful. So nice to not have to delete apps for storage. Easy on the eyes, fast, intuitive."
iphone xr,iPhone.Love this phone so far. The camera is great and I love the different colors to choose from.
iphone xr,"Like the bigger screen! Real easy to use , like not having the home button and face recognition !"
