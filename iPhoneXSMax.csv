iPhone Model	Reviews
iPhone XS Max	"Large Screen, Not for Single-Hand Use"
iPhone XS Max	"Happy Happy Joy Joy.I was mostly content with my iPhone X but always wished it was a little bigger. The XS Max fits the bill. Biggest iPhone screen ever but in the same body size virtually as the Plus models is exactly what I wanted. Excellent display. Face ID , which worked perfectly for me already appears to be faster and more accurate ( I didn’t have issues often with Face ID not working like some people say they have though so it’s just a perk of an upgrade versus an issue being fixed). Gold color is gorgeous. iOS 12 is great. 

Only negative I have come across is that the XS/XS MAX does not work with my Belkin stand charger. It constantly cycles as if it isn’t staying plugged in. Researched and found out that it is listed as not compatible. Not sure if Belkin will be able to address the issue or if it’s now just an accessory I can no longer use. Oh and for those that still need it you won’t get the headphone adapter included in the XS/XS Max package. You will have to purchase one if you need it."
iPhone XS Max	"A joy to use, reliable, fast, great screen."
iPhone XS Max	Best Bestbuy Purchase ever
iPhone XS Max	"finally.I love my xs max stupid name but I love the phone they apple finally made a ""plus"" phone and coming from the regular iPhone x its a nice upgrade if you have huge hands like myself battery life is hit and miss and unlike some people I haven't had any connection issues if your an iPhone person that wants a huge screen this is the phone for you and I came from a Galaxy Note 9 and its a great for if your an android person that said I have nothing bad to say about it I switched over because of my job .

CONS
Big screen might be overwhelming 
battery life as I mention is hit and miss"
iPhone XS Max	"Zero regrets! I upgraded to the XS Max from a 7 Plus. the phone is virtually the same size but there is a huge difference in screen size. I'd thought about going w/ the smaller XS to experience a smaller phone, but at the last minute decided to go with the XS Max...a decision I definitely do not regret. The screen is enormous and beautiful - great to watch videos or TV. I find myself using my iPad less and less. I was also a little skeptical if I'd be happy with faceID vs the fingerprint sensor but my skepticism was unfounded. faceID is so easy to use and makes the overall experience much better. Only in very bright light have I had any issue and had to fall back to typing in my code, but even that has been rare. It is blazing fast, and with the awesome screen size and faceID, I could not be happier with this phone."

iPhone XS Max	"iPhone XS Max.I get a new iPhone every 2 years. I never get those so-called mid new releases. I laughed at the iPhone X when it came out and I seen it. This XS Max isn’t that. Trust me! This is why I only upgrade, every 2 years only! I told myself, if they don’t make any extreme changes, that I would be keeping my 7 Plus. I was the first to have the iPhone XS Max. Best Buy was giving them out at 8 AM. Before the cellphone stores. It’s a refreshing change. I’m just wondering, what took them so long? It’s extremely expensive though. Lots of improvements! Great phone. Apple has always been good at taking what’s out there and making it better!"
iPhone XS Max	"Best iPhone Ever.I contemplated getting the regular XS but compared screen size when playing video and for me the XS Max won it out!
After having the iphone 5S , 6 and 7 plus now having the 
XS Max , I can honestly say the XS Max is the best iPhone ever.
Its fluid and very easy to use. I personally like the size and the pictures are amazing. 
The battery could be a little better but nonetheless it still holds just enough juice until the next charge.
The speaker is clear and antenna seems to get a better and clearer reception. Calls are clear and the overall feel is exceptional.
I'd recommend the new iPhone XS Max to anyone looking for a new level of experience on the latest iPhone.

iPhone XS Max	"More Screen!Coming from the iPhone 8 Plus, I am very happy with the iPhone XS Max due to the screen real estate. In my opinion, this is an improved model of the 8 Plus since the physical size is nearly identical. As usual, navigation in iOS is smooth and consistent even with the newly released iOS 12. Personally, I don’t love the notch and wish it was excluded from this model, but you forget about it after a while. I had the previous iPhone X for a very brief time because it was just way too small for my hands. This is a fantastic incremental upgrade even at the steep asking price. The gold on this years iPhone is my favorite gold yet."

iPhone XS Max	"Love the screen size! I was not a fan of the size of the iPhone X, so I was glad Apple decided to make the Max- it is perfect for us big phone lovers. I remember reading certain reviews before I got the phone that compared the Max to an iPad Mini, which made me nervous because no one wants a phone as big as a tablet. But it’s perfect, just like my Plus but a better screen which makes watching videos and reading on the phone so much more enjoyable. It was easy to adjust to having no home button, which was another concern of mine before getting the phone. Overall very pleased with all the new features. I love the phone!"
iPhone XS Max	"Great Phone.For me this was a legitimate upgrade coming from the 6s Plus. The camera and battery life are the most impressive. before applying batt life saving tips from the net the phone would last the full length of the day while playing games sporadically and constant use of texting, emails, and trips to social medias. Now, with the batt saving tips the phone lasts all day and all night until I plug it in to go to sleep. recommend getting a case and screen protector ASAP. amazing technology but would not be worth the investment if upgrading from previous gen."
iPhone XS Max	"Switch from Android.I have had Android phones since smartphones started. The new iPhone has been very reliable and a big step up from my Samsung Galaxy 8+. The battery lasts all day, performance is great and the face ID is flawless even at night. The camera is also a huge improvement over the Samsung. It did take a little time to get used to IOS vs Android but so far I am really liking how everything works. I also got the watch and I must say the 2 devices work really well together. Much better then the Samsung phone and watch."
iPhone XS Max	"After my iPhone X was stolen (my fault completely for setting it down on restaurant table) I then went to bestbuy the next day and purchased a New iPhone XS Max. The speed when it comes to fb, games or just surfing the web on the iPhone XS Max is Amazing (big difference between x and XS). Kind of Glad my iPhone X was stolen bc if not I probably would have not gotten my hands on this phone also Although I have apple protection plan, I always protect my phone with the best cases I can find which in this case Otterbox seems only right. Thank you Bestbuy once again."
iPhone XS Max	"A worthy upgrade.I upgraded from the iPhone X for the larger size and better battery life. This is a beautiful phone. I would recommend for anyone looking to upgrade from an older model iPhone. The speed is amazing. Photos are outstanding.
Just make sure you buy a case and screen protection. I would suggest a glass protector. I bought a Belkin from Apple and they installed it with their machine at their physical store. The protector is expensive ($40.00 yikes!), but knowing it will be perfectly aligned will give you peace of mind."
iPhone XS Max	"Truly the best phone available.his review is from Apple - iPhone XS Max 256GB - Silver

I am sure there's not much I can say that hasn't been said but this is truly the finest phone I have ever used.

Speedy. Gorgeous screen. The Camera effects are unbelievable. iOs 12.X continues to improve on the most efficient mobile operating system out there,.

CONS: Clearly not inexpensive. At this rate, Apple will have $2,000 phones in a few years :(

Battery life seems somewhat less than my 7 Plus.

Overall, feels great in the hand. Looks beautiful. Performs better than my Mac Mini :P"
iPhone XS Max	"The best. The best phone on the market. Using the phone with other Apple devices in the Apple ecosystem is a plus. The camera is awesome and the OLED display is vibrant. The speakers sound great. I receive a lot of laughs with the animoji characters. The Face ID seems to work well and having no home button is something you will get used to.

I skipped the first X iteration as I was in the middle of my contract and wanted to see the FaceID technology mature a little more. Overall, this is another great phone by Apple and I recommend it."
iPhone XS Max	"Better than I thought! I love this phone! It is faster than my iPhone 7 Plus and I don't miss the home button at all, and I thought I would! There is hardly a learning curve at all regarding the missing home button. The Face ID works perfect, I LOVE IT! So far the battery has lasted me all day. The wireless charging is great! I have had no issues with charging via cord either. The only down side I have experienced is WiFi connection, it has been very spotty. I will have to go to Verizon and have that checked out. Other than that, I highly recommend."
iPhone XS Max	"Great upgrade from 6s plus.My wife bought this for me because she was tired of me complaining about the lack of space on my phone. Plus. I cracked my screen and pieces of glass were falling out of it. It is so much faster than my 6s plus. It is hard to remember and get used to the lack of a home button, I only took away a star because of my frustration of no home button and no auxiliary port. I have to buy a separate connection so I can listen to my music in the car, Other than that, it it another great apple product."
iPhone XS Max	"If you’re an apple fan and must have the latest technology then go for it but If you’re already rocking an 8 or up and low on cash I’d wait. But if you balling out of control go for it and enjoy the new Animoji’s and all the other update iOS 12 has to offer techie

iPhone XS Max	"Purchased iPhone X for my wife few months ago, gave it to my son and purchased this iPhone XS max for my wife as replacement.. my wife is using it to capture videos of my son during soccer games, they are much improved from prior phone. She loves it, and I love it too.

iPhone XS Max	"I am in love with this phone. The screen size is amazing. Allows me to complete my business work in my phone instead of having to work on my laptop all the time. Face ID is awesome. Only thing that bothers me a little bit is the weight when I’m holding it for a long time

iPhone XS Max	"No more fumbling with a six digit code to use my phone. Just pick it up. I do miss the percentage of battery life showing. Also, instead of glancing at my phone when I get a ding for an e-mail it says notification. I have to pick it up to see what it is. Other than that, I love it.

iPhone XS Max	"I upgraded from the iPhone 6s Plus and what an upgrade it is!!!! The screen is amazing, the speakers are loud and clear, the camera blows me away. If you have an older device this is a no brainer, especially if you are coming from a Plus sized device. The white/silver looks great too!

iPhone XS Max	"The iPhone XS Max is a great choice is you are an apple person. I haven't had any issues with it. The screen size and resolution is impressive. It holds a charge really well, and recharges very quickly. Definitely recommend to others who are in the market for a new phone!

iPhone XS Max	"I love my new iPhone! all the features make it so much easier to use. I think this iPhone is the most significantly better compared to previous versions. The only thing is I wish they had a white and black color option rather than just black with the silver, gold or space gray accents.

iPhone XS Max	"I'm personally an HTC or Google guy myself but my wife is an Apple girl and was in dire need of replacing her relic of an Apple 5S. She was going back and forth between the XS and the XS Max. She is very happy she went with the Max. The text is considerably larger when reading websites or ebooks.

iPhone XS Max	"going from the ""button"" to the no button was so much easier than even I thought it would be, the camera is spot on. the price of course not so much so this phone will have to last longer than my previous one so with that said I hope that the battery turns out to be better than the last ones

iPhone XS Max	"I like the big screen and the pics this thing takes is incredible. Watching a movie with the new screen is amazing and most important, because at the end of the day it needs to make calls, the sound quality when hearing another person is excellent. The high price was a tough pill to swallow though.

iPhone XS Max	"I use this phone for everything! Hardly slows down or crashes, Maybe once in the two months I’ve owned it. I mainly use a wireless charging dock and have only had issues of fully charging when I had a thicker case and a magnet for magnetic mounting. Overall, I am satisfied. Upgraded from a 7 plus.

iPhone XS Max	"I WAS RELUCTANT TO GO BACK TO THE IPHONE AFTER BGOING TO ANDROID. BUT I'M GLAD I DID. ASIDE FROM SOME WIFI ISSUES, THIS PHONE MADE ME REALIZE SOME OF THE ANGST I HAD WITH THE SAMSUNG S9 PLUS I HAD. (TEXTING, SOFTWARE UPDATES). THE BUILD AND QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH TO ME. REMINDS ME OF THE VERY 1ST IPHONE

iPhone XS Max	"Have yet to have an issue. It's big, I like them big. I like the animoji & mimoji thing. It takes some getting used to the no home button. Camera is nice. The only thing that kinda sucks is because it's so new and big is that there are not a wide assortment of cases out which isn't a phone issue itself.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max	"Overall amazing phone, camera is spectacular, looks amazing and the removal of the home button seems to be a plus even thoughbit was annoying at first. Only drawback seems to be that the battery life didnt last as long as i would have hoped for the amount the phone costs. However still the best phone on the market right now.

iPhone XS Max	"The XS Max has proven to be a pretty nice phone thus far. The camera abilities alone make it worth the upgrade! The price is off the charts, but I think people need to come to grips with inevitably continual rises in price of these phones as the technology keeps changing and their abilities continue to increase.

iPhone XS Max	"i’ve had an iPhone 4s, 5, 6s, 7, and 8 plus in the past, but none of them comes close to what the iPhone XS Max has in store for you. The iPhone 8 Plus was also a good buy if you’re looking for something a bit cheaper but the XS max is really amazing. Personally love the infinity screen, face recognition, and the camera!

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max	"This is my first cellphone/smartphone and it is just terrific. The visuals and sound are great and the larger size is much more appealing than the smaller, older iPhones. I love the mobility and freedom this phone provides and I think it will pay for itself in the increased productivity it allows for . I look forward to using the camera and video a lot.

iPhone XS Max	"This thing is a beast! It's gorgeous, easy to use, and a real delight. I was against Face ID at first, not because I didn't like the idea of it, but because I was unsure how well it would work when laying in bed, etc. Well, it works great! It's fast and fun to be honest. Big screen is perfect, easy to hold, very fast, excellent camera, I love this phone!

iPhone XS Max	" admit, I was hesitant on purchasing the IphoneXS because of some of the reviews I had read. I was upgrading from an Iphone 5c, so it was a big jump. This phone is fantastic....a slight learning curve, but I am very happy with it. I like the bigger sized screen, which makes reading emails and text messages MUCH easier.
Very happy with my purchase.

iPhone XS Max	"The performance on this phone is amazing, battery life is great and love the fact that my screen goes all the way to the edge. The pictures taken from this phone are amazing and it comes with some new features. One thing I don't like is the fact that Apple used glass for the back again, and the phone is on the heavy side, maybe due to the big glass on the back

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max	"Love the upgrades. Led screen is crazy awesome. Didn’t know if I would like it without the main button on the front? Now I think it should of been this way all along. Love how the screen goes all the way to the edges. Camera is outstanding. Only bad thing. I wouldn’t even say it’s a con. But the Whole thing is glass. Very fragile. Get the Apple insurance. And get a good case

iPhone XS Max	"I’m one of the many that get a new iPhone each year. However for a few years now I haven’t felt like I’ve been getting anything different (other than a model number). This time it feels really different! Much bigger screen (having gone from the 8 plus, returned the X after an hour) and noticeable display improvement. This phone makes having a tablet unnecessary. Good job yet again, Apple.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max	"Face it, if you paid the price for the phone like I did, you go straight to the largest screen available. It fits great in my hands and when upgrading from a 7 Plus, I couldn’t be happier! I really enjoy the wireless charging and vivid OLED screen. I couldn’t wait for Apple to come out with their charger so I grabbed a quick charger from Samsung. I can safely say I won’t be going back to wires.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max	"I am definitely an Apple junkie and won’t own anything but Apple products. I am enjoying this new phone but have to say it’s a little quirky in that it requires a reboot every week or two to keep the cellular signal and other features working properly. It’s not a big deal and may change with updates but it’s not something I’ve had to do with past iPhones. Overall, though I would still recommend it!!!

iPhone XS Max	"This is my 4th iPhone but my first large display version. I love the large retina display. One reason I upgraded is for the camera. The camera quality is stunning and good enough to replace carrying a camera with me separately. I really like the ease and speed of the facial recognition. My experience with the battery is that is has actually lasted me 2 days between charges and when I do charge the phone it charges quickly.

iPhone XS Max	"I held off on getting the original iPhone X because of the reviews. However, this iPhone version has been nothing but great. I went with the iPhone XS max and glad I did. Screen size is perfect (same as Galaxy S9 plus). Camera is unbelievable and the phone is very fast when surfing the web or using apps. The screen size is what really made me go with the XS max. Some people think it's too big, but I think it is a perfect size!

iPhone XS Max	"I recently upgraded to the iPhone XS Max from the iPhone 7 Plus. The XS Max’s main feature is its immersive display. It is great to have for media consumption. It may be big for some but if you are coming from one of the older Plus size phone then it won’t be an issue. The XS Max has the same footprint as the previous Plus size phones but with the edge to edge display. The phone is very snappy all around. I am satisfied with my upgrade.

iPhone XS Max	"I recently picked up the iPhone Xs Max. I have had pretty much every iPhone since the first one. This one by far is the best yet. The screen is amazing. The speed is by far top notch. The quality is pretty much the same as any Apple product. I love the size of the screen. I have to say I had the X too but it seemed to small for me. I’m coming from a 8 Plus and this is perfect. If you can afford it why not upgrade. You won’t be disappointed.

 I would recommend this to a friend"
iPhone XS Max	"The screen alone is worth the upgrade. The 6.5 inch screen is just so big and beautiful, still having the reachability feature makes it manageable if you have small hands. Turning on reachability allows you to swipe down in the bottom right and brings the screen down making it easier to reach stuff up top. If you’re coming from a plus model iPhone this will feel very familiar at least size wise, if you’re coming from a smaller phone it really doesn’t feel to big.

iPhone XS Max	"This is an upgrade from the iPhone 6S Plus and the difference is astounding. The phone is light years ahead of my previous device. I pre-ordered the phone to be picked up on release day. I was a bit nervous not knowing if the devices would arrive on schedule but not only were the devices received but I received the notification the night before my pick up day. The speed if the new processor is fantastic, the color is the best I've seen on a phone. It's definitely worth the price.

iPhone XS Max	"I was hesitant to get the iPhone X when it first came out - way too much money. However, my iPhone 7 was in need of upgrade. I am so glad I got the XS Max. The 6.5” OLED full screen display is brilliant. I am really amazed at how clear videos are. 
Once I learned how to use the new touch screen - everything seamlessly flows. It is so easy to use. And the facial recognition works in the background, you don’t have to do anything special. Just pick the phone up to face level, and it unlocks automatically.

iPhone XS Max	"The iPhone XS Max is awesome! Incredible display, great sound quality, and I love the large size. I upgraded from the X just for the bigger display because the X was a great phone. I had just always wished it were a little larger. No home button is awesome, all the gestures feel so natural after only a little use. You will not miss the home button! Battery life is also better. It is simply a high quality device all around and would recommend to everyone! Also, Best Buy is a great place to do your upgrade or first time iPhone purchase!

iPhone XS Max	"The iPhone XS Max is a wonderful device that works brilliantly with Apple's ecosystem and tightly managed operating system. The camera works as advertised, the screen is beautiful, and the battery life exceeds my expectations for a phone that is used as heavily as I use mine (for both work and personal usage). 

The only downside at all is the skyrocketing prices that are now associated with flagship devices across the board. While this isn't an Apple specific issue, it does warrant a second thought before deciding to spend over 1,000$ for a smartphone.

iPhone XS Max	"So far so good with my new iPhone which was a replacement for my iPhone 6S Plus. Same size, but more screen area so able to see more. Has taken some time to get used to the swiping motion you use to open things rather than pushing the home button, but the good thing is there are no longer open pages which I would forever forget to close and then spend some time closing them all when it seemed that my battery was depleting or the phone seemed to slow down.

iPhone XS Max	"This is the best phone that I have ever owned. I used to have an apple phone back when they first came out and 3-4 models after that. Quickly I realized that apple was not making changes to screen size or functionality. That’s when I went with Android and been there ever since till this phone. Let me tell you that this max iPhone is awesome, amazing and better then android for several reasons. One reason is the apple ecosystem, it just works so flawlessly and the quality of apps is equally amazing. Overall the build quality and overall phone is very premium compared to the competitors. I recommend to anyone family and friends.

iPhone XS Max	"Bought this phone for the wife, the Gold looks pretty good this time too and apparently it is one of the more popular colors. Anyway, the highlight here is the OLED screen, which if you have never owned an OLED television or spent any time with an OLED screen the difference in colors and blacks will be a delight to you. Everything else is as you would expect from an iPhone, high quality. If you have never owned an iPhone before, this is a little pricey but if you take care of it then it will serve you 4 years pretty easily, and longer but after about 4 years you may start to notice not all apps will be compatible with it anymore (typically games and such).

iPhone XS Max	"I’m very impressed with Xs Max. The notch was something i thought about when upgrading from the 7 Plus but I have to say I’m used to it now. Also the swipe gestures and being without the home button I’m used to. It feels very natural now. The OLED screen is fantastic and the size is perfect. The battery life is improved too. I use it all day moderately and it’s still at least 50% left at night. A Very powerful and snappy phone. I only really have one negative about the phone and it’s small. I liked seeing the battery percentage always in sight but now you have to scroll down on the right to see it. Other than that small complaint. It’s a perfect phone.

iPhone XS Max	"Honestly guys I can’t express how much love I have for the new iPhone XS Max. I’ve owned an iPhone ever since the 3GS when I was 7. I’ve owned other phones along the way like Samsung’s, Sony’s, a old Windows phone. I honestly would never leave the Apple world of technology. The Face ID isn’t even an issue if you are worried about that because every app I use with a password or that uses Touch ID allows for Face ID as well, that includes USAA a Government banking app! The cameras a absolutely phenomenal as well, talk about a professional level outcome! The screen is gorgeous too, honestly the notch is unique and I like it, it doesn’t interfere or get in the way with anything.

iPhone XS Max	"This is the best iPhone I’ve had. The battery life is amazing even if I’m on it all day long it’ll still have a big amount of percentage left on it. To me, I feel it chargers pretty quickly and I don’t feel the need to buy the faster charger. Even though it doesn’t come with the small cable for the headphones, it’s only $9 to get another one so I’m not complaining. The size of the screen is also great and the colors are vibrant on it. The camera is amazing as well and it takes great pictures of everything even in low lighting. I myself think it is worth the price. If you’re not picky about the small stuff like the adapter for earphones, or for it to be charged in two seconds, then you’ll love it as much as I do.

iPhone XS Max	"iPhone XS Max is a great phone! I had the iPhone X when it first came out. I disliked it due to a few reasons, size and Techical glitches that I ran into. 

Now with the Max I absolutely love it. It’s fast, it hasn’t glitches or locked up on me. 

The camera is great for normal photos or snap chatting.

The phone service seems to work really well in most places that I go. 

The battery seems to last a while. I work through Gmail on the sarfari for my job. It gets used quite a bit during the day and I always have battery for when I am relaxing before bed. 

The facial recognition works extremely well. I haven’t had it have any issues not unlocking my phone. 

If you are an iPhone fan or looking to switch to this phone I would recommend it.

iPhone XS Max	"I was upgrading from an iPhone 6 Plus, not the 6s model, and needless to say there have been some pretty decent upgrades in 4 years as far as phones go. The best part of this upgrade, is the OLED screen. Assuming that most people have experience with an iPhone that are considering this one, 64GB is not going to be enough if you enjoy taking a lot of photos and/or videos without uploading this to a computer, online cloud options, or deleting some. Of the 64GB, the operating system takes approximately 6GB as of now, leaving you with 58GB for apps, photos, etc. Plenty for me, but just know your data usage and consider if this will be enough for you. If you have never owned an iPhone before, this is a great option that is basically a miniature laptop so take good care of it and it can last you 4-5 years pretty easy.

iPhone XS Max	"The display is what put it over the top for me and was the main reason I purchased it! The screen is just beautiful and big and that’s what I love! Coming from a plus model, I’m use to the big phones and have had one since they first introduced them, so the size doesn’t bother me at all. With it being all screen now it can be a little more challenging to reach certain parts of the screen even with big hands, but Apple still has the reachability feature on these which makes it easier. The phone feels amazing and very high quality. iOS over the last few generations lost that buttery smooth feel it use to have, Apple has definitely changed that with iOS 12. iOS 12 is a big on improvement on all hardware that will run it, but on the Xs and Xs Max with the 4GB of ram it is seemless like it use to be. These aren’t cheap phones , but they’re definitely worth it if you’re in the market for one. If I had one knock it would be that Apple still ships these with the 5w charging brick even though these phones support fast charging. This to me inexcusable for a phone of this price in 2018/19. If you like a big screen, this thing will satisfy all your needs.

iPhone XS Max	"I've had an iPhone 6 Plus for 4 and a half years and I've been very happy with it. I checked out the new phones and saw that the XS Max was the same size as my 6 Plus but the whole screen was used. So I purchased it. It works a little different than the plus (no home button, shuts off differently, among a few things), but I've gotten used to the differences and I actually prefer them. I love the Face recognition feature, and I love swiping up to get out of an app. It's a lot faster than the Plus and Siri is easier to use. I haven't had any problems charging it because I charge it wirelessly. I love that feature. Apple products are great because I can back them up to my computer and when I get a new product just restore it from the backup and everything is there. My games are where I left off, all of my texts are there. It's great. The only downside is it's a little heavier but that's nothing. So all in all, I'm really glad I bought this phone.

iPhone XS Max	"This phone is decently fast and has ok battery life. It’s still way overpriced for what you get.

iPhone XS Max	"Love the large screen, but the battery life is lacking, Sometimes with just normal use, I only egt about 6 hours.

iPhone XS Max	"The phones are great but half of the calls I have made the last month have failed or don’t ring. I’ve spent 7 hours with “advanced” Verizon level tech support and still the problem persists to no end

iPhone XS Max	"excited to use the large screen display and faceID for the very first time, given only 3 stars due to the issue observed with charging during standby mode and hoping this will be addressed soon with iOS 12.x

iPhone XS Max	"I found the new iPhone XS max not to be that much different from my iPhone 7 Plus. I am having buyers remorse. I miss the home button. having a hard time getting used of that. But it does take great pictures. That’s why I’m giving it 3 Stars.

iPhone XS Max	"The phone is what you would expect from Apple, Innovation is behind Samsung. For a $1200 phone, I was surprised that it takes so long to charge and Apple won’t admit there is an issue. If you search Google, thousands of people are having the same problem.

iPhone XS Max	"I always used an iphone, so when i had to replace my phone i got the Max 64GB, i heard that it is the best iphone ever, paid around $1200 for it, i have couple things to say about it:
1- it froze couple times in the first week, worked better after an update but still freezing in the first week is bad.
2- charging the phone is slow, i use original cable and adapter but still slow
3- the lack of finger sensor is bad

iPhone XS Max	"I got this phone on release day. I bought the iPhone X s Max 512 gig. I’ve been an iPhone owner since the iPhone 4. So believe my I’ve owned and used many iPhones. Once they added Touch ID to the iPhone that was by far my favorite and most used feature in an iPhone ever. Now I didn’t own the iPhone X because I prefer a larger phone and it was to small for me, so this is my first time ever using Face ID and not having a finger print sensor anymore and I freaking hate it! Removing the finger print sensor makes me dislike this phone. I didn’t think it’d matter to me but it does enormously. Use to be so easy logging into my iPhone 8 Plus. And it never failed. Face ID fails for me at least 50% of the time. Don’t get me wrong thie rest of the phone is amazing to me. I love it but not having a finger print sensor ruins this phone to me. I’ll keep this phone for 2 years but if Apple doesn’t bring back some form of Touch ID in the future I think I’ll be looking elsewhere for my next phone. It’d be so easy to turn the apple logo on the back of the phone into a finger print scanner. And if it were I’d give this phone 5 stars. But getting rid of it makes me hate this phone. I did give it 3 stars cause the rest of the phone I love but bring it back apple or I’m done. Thank you.

iPhone XS Max	"I'm normally an Apple fan but definitely not this time! Went from the X to the XS Max and had several issues with my unit! Connectivity issues, blue tint pretty bad, charge gate, etc. Took it back a d exchanged for the Note9 and have had NO issues at all, soooooo glad I switched! That's way to much $ for all the problems!!

iPhone XS Max	Very good iPhone. Amazing oled screen.
iPhone XS Max	It’s nice
iPhone XS Max	"Great phone, working very well, unlocked and sealed just as described. Very happy with my purchase."
iPhone XS Max	This phone is overpriced garbage. I purchased the phone brand new and it won’t charge sometimes leaving me with a dead phone at work. The phone is also just too large for practical use and the resolution is disappointing. I can’t believe they would slap such a large price tag on this phone without making sure it works properly. I returned and ordered a new note 8 instead. Save your money and buy a different phone.
