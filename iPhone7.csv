iPhone 7,"Faulty.Love the design and a great phone but sometimes the home, power and volume buttons become unresponsive and other times the camera is just completely blank or blurred and I'm unable to take pictures. Also lags here or there. Don't really recommend."
iphone 7,"Total rip-off these phones are defective.I bought this phone back in February and it developed a hardware issue. My phone (Iphone 7 128GB) recently developed an issue in cellular signal, still searching for network and could not recognize the carrier, so i did a reset of network settings and restart the phone then the screen goes to black and white lines and the phone restart itself continuously tell i remove the SIM card or put it in airplane mode, and i have been tried another SIM cards but the problem still exist.
Thereafter, i connect it to ITunes and ITunes told me that you have to update phone to IOS V. 11 but actually i already updated my phone to IOS V.11. then i tried to update the phone but unfortunately the process failed with the unknown error (-1) and the phone currently stuck in a recovery mode and also i tried restore process and face the same error. I took very good care of this phone bear in mind, it's in near mint condition. So disappointing that they do this to people. Never buy a phone off of Amazon, its too much of an investment to risk buying from these shady sellers. Buy it from your carrier, get a protection plan and warranty otherwise you'll be stuck with a $800.00 piece of metal and glass and the seller will tell you ""It's your problem now, sorry."" I went through Apple and T-Mobile neither of the two could do anything about it."
iphone 7,Do not buy if you have Verizon!Do not buy if you have Verizon! I purchased this to use on Verizon only to be told this phone isnâ€™t compatible even though it says it can be used by any carrier
iphone 7,"I'm very disappointed. It started all good like everything else in ...This phone did not even last a year. I'm very disappointed.

It started all good like everything else in life and then the phone came up with an error.
checked online and its a RAM failure in the phone. Of course, my not venture is to contact the seller, but don't be surprised I cant get in contact with them.

I'm done"

iphone 7,"it the best one yet? I think so!'m back and it's better than ever

I was in the market for a new phone, and decided since it was the actual launch day, I'd go down to my ATT store and purchase something. I wasn't sure that I would purchase an iPhone 7 (honestly, about 80 percent sure I would) and I waited in line. The whole actual waiting part wasn't as tremendously large as it's quoted as being. I really didn't have to wait all that long, which I think is in part to a lot of people not seeing the potential in this phone.

After I purchased the phone, I immediately went and got a Charging case from the same store. This not only allows me to charge my phone, but use my headphones at the same time. I don't have a need for headphones that I can lose (AIRPODS) and I like that Apple actually gives an alternative to you, you get to use corded earpods, and if your battery case is charged (essentially an external battery), you have about 1-2 days of full fledge battery life (and I use my phone a lot) and can still use the headphones.

The speed of this one is what amazed me to be totally honest with you. I'm coming back to Apple after a small break and using a GoPhone (ZTE MAVEN) on the postpaid service. The Maven did well honestly, and I kept it around for a lot longer than I usually do. It just worked, and that can't be said for most phones. I'd experimented with iOS10 with my iPad, but I can say, it works a lot better on this than the iPad. Games, videos, even texting, are so much faster, it's hard to believe. The Digital Touch message feature is a nice touch, however, how much I'll use it I've yet to see.

Having no physical home button is not a ""biggie"" to me. There is a haptic feedback button in place of this, which is essentially a touch sensitive button, but it actually has a feeling as though you're pressing it. It's kind of how the trackpad works on the MacBooks. A nice touch. It took a little bit to get used to, and choose the ""touch"" I wanted, but after doing so, it's been easy.

I'm not displeased as many people would think about the headphone issue, as many people are. I use headphones, but so long as there is a workaround, which Apple has done, I'm not bothered. I can still use the earpods with the lightning connector. I guess it would be an inconvenience to you if your battery-case (if you bought one, or buy one) is dead, and I can actually see that being an issue. But this is why you need to watch battery levels.

The camera is EXCELLENT. I've been a photographer for the better part of my life, and can leave my Nikon at home and walk out with this and be confident that any shots I need to take, can be taken with this. HDR is a must.

Sound quality with this unit is very good, however, I must say, if you have a screen protector on the phone, you can legitimately feel the sound coming thru the speakers, thru the screen protector. Every phone that has had a screen protector that I've tested on the iPhone 7, has had this issue. All of the floor models that don't are fine. It doesn't bother me tremendously, but for a high end phone, you'd think that design would have been looked at before the phone was released.

Overall, I'm pleased, and I think I will be for the foreseeable future. But I usually love almost every phone that I've owned, so, I'm not sure how biased I actually might be. As the experience continues, I'll be sure to update my review with any updates that would be beneficial."
iphone 7,"
It happens to be the best phone on the market....Iphone 7 is pretty solid. It's best feature hands down is the waterproof, FINALLY. The speed is incredible. The Touch ID is faster than you might want. The haptic feedback home button is genius. The rose gold is stunning. I upgraded from an i6 and I am glad I did.
"
iphone 7,Four stars. Expensive
iphone 7,"Outright lie in the title. As previous reviewers have pointed out, this iPhone was not unlocked. For people specifically buying this to use internationally, I would recommend any other seller"
iphone 7,"
4.0 out of 5 starsa great leap from the iPhone 6s, but not enough to keep me using iPhones. This is probably what the iPhone 6 should've looked like from the beginning. That space grey was boringly ugly and tho this looks much better, it's just a little bit too late for me.

Rumors suggested a sexy deep blue or something, that would've kept me using this a tad longer and am sure Apple were about to do it ... but anyways

the phone is the typical better than last year's iPhone
better performance, not much better battery and a better camera

The performance and feel difference were great!
it just felt that much faster and felt way newer than previous upgrades have felt, the camera was way better, especially in low light and the battery was a typical iPhone batter

But there was nothing else to speak about regarding the device, you just get new software features which they optimize best for the new iPhone, so you're basically buying the latest iOS operator rather than a new phone.

There is no discovery too, you just load your backup and here you are at exactly the same homescreen trying a couple of features that are probably cool, just not cool enough.

I was scared of moving to Android, my last attempt with the Nexus 6 failed epically due to the world famous crashes and a much much worse battery life, I may have had a faulty device but that was enough to stop me from getting one of my all time want phones, the Moto X Style Edition.

So I managed to get the Moto Z and use it with the iPhone 7 for a while using the same number on two different sim cards, it didn't take me long to start reaching for the Moto Z and leave the iPhone at home all together ... and just like that I moved to Android and I think I moved to Android at the right time cuz Android was sluggish and crashy, while iOS was snappy and reliable

and I think starting iOS 7, iPhones started to degrade a little faster and later iOS versions started to become just a little bit unstable

while Android starting from Marshmallow started getting a little bit more reliable and"
iphone 7,"Awesome phone! .Honestly I love the upgrade I made to the iPhone 7 (from iPhone 6). It is fast with the latest IOS 10 and loving the 128gb. I would not recommend getting the lowest space possible which is 32gb because it sucked having the 16gb iPhone 6. Also they did a study saying the 32gb model is slower as well. The one downside I have about the phone is the phone is missing the headphone jack, but they removed it so the phone could be water resistant and so they could put in a better vibration to the phone. They also removed the home button the takes place in every iPhone before the 7, but they replaced it with a touch button that tricks you into thinking it's a real button. Don't get this phone if you already have the iPhone 6s because it will not be a huge upgrade. PS. The pictures are ones I took on this phone, not pictures of the phone."
iphone 7,"Phone is dumb as I cannot believe. . Totally ridiculous and dumb phone. I am used to Samsung, Galaxies, LQ and even other cheaper phones out there. This is my first I phone. I find it totally dumb. While understand no phone is perfect and all have certain pros and cons; for the life of me I cannot understand that the Iphone is something that people like and are willing to pay good money for it. I understand that the camera and optic characteristics of this phone are something people like. For my part, I use my phone mainly as a phone or texting device. And these are the areas where I find the phone is lacking. To name a couple. When a call enters, I do not have an option (or not always) of rejecting the call or answer with a message, there is only one option: answer. After a call from a new number, in other phones, if I touch the number it will give an opportunity to convert into a contact, call the person or text. With the iphone, if you touch the number it will call the person back. I went into the movies yesterday and, as it is customary by civilized people, I muted the bloody phone in question. But the phone decided to ring loud when a call entered. Another thing that bugs the hell out of me is that the phone decides that, since I am driving, ""it will not disturb me and let any calls enter..."" I thought I had bought a phone, not a parent. Before you buy any phone from this company make sure you give it a good test and make sure that the actions that you take for granted in your other phones will be included with this new phone and good luck
"
iphone 7,"Heads up about the new Haptic home button, it doesnt work etip or rubber gloves on THE HOME BUTTON ONLY WORKS WITH BARE HANDS.

This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone. No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves. None of them worked with my phone. So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind. Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold! I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone.

HERE IS A SOLUTION, ........with extra steps.

I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:

Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on.

This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot. Then to unlock your iPhone 7, press the sleep button on the right of the phone, then press the Assistive Touch dot, touch the home button and enter your SIX digit pass code.

I want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into all of the extra steps to open the phone, because the extra steps are EACH time you have to access your phone.

OTHER CONS

1. I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard. It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5. Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen. I have tried it on every sensitivity level.
2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works. Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over.

I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects."
iphone 7,"I hate the 7; buy a 5 instead. The iPhone 7 is a serious step backward by Apple. Prior to this, my biggest complaint was the battery life. However, I could have the phone plugged in charging, while listening to music on my headset or talking on the phone. With only 1 plug now, instead of 2, you can either charge your phone OR use your headset, but not both. Further my old headsets do not fit the 7, and the 7 headset won't fit my iMac. I bought two splitters and adapters and the splitters did not work, and the adapter is hard to keep up with.

Second, the touch screen is insensitive and about 1/3 of my touches are not detected. There is a heavy and a light touch but when holding the phone with one hand and / or typing quickly, you cannot control the different touch levels.

In the past, when you bought an Apple product, you got a solid operating system that had been thoroughly tested and you did not have to update all the time. Not anymore; you can spend as much time updating your phone and apps as you spend using it now.

Many of the new features are a nuisance unless you are a teenager, and you cannot turn them off, and they constantly try to cram the Apple Subscription Music service down your throat. I want to turn that feature off, and not be asked about it another hundred times.

I loved my old iPhone 5 despite the short battery life. Given the computing power of the phone, I could understand that, and had back up battery packs I could use. But I hate my iPhone 7 and would highly recommend against buying one."
iphone 7,"Improvements over the 6S!! The iPhone 7 offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note.

- Better display (wider colour gamut)
- Better taptic engine
- 5 grams lighter
- IP67 Water and dust resistance
- Way better A10 Fusion CPU
- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p)
- Rear camera have OIS
- Better low light performance
- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE
- Slightly better battery life
- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)

The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note. Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!"
iphone 7,"Great except for missing headphone jack, I upgraded to the iPhone 7 and have to say that most of my experience has been good. The larger size was a change but after a few weeks I really like that. The one main complaint is the removal of the headphone jack. My home stereo system has a connection, but is not blue tooth enabled, which means I either no longer listen to my music on my home entertainment system, or I now have to buy a new stereo, plus now my earphones are basically worthless. Plus my truck isn't enabled either, so now I just listen on the phone. The jury is still out as to whether I'm going to downgrade, as the other features are nice, if not for the headphone jack change it would have been a 5 star. If you only have blue tooth devices to connect to, go ahead and upgrade."
iphone 7,"Great Phone. The iPhone 7 is a great phone for everyday tasks. The phone has a very solid build with a metal back and a matte black finish that doesnâ€™t slip in your hand. The matte black also doesnâ€™t show fingerprints like most shiny phones do. The front of the phone is a durable glass that does show fingerprints but cleans easily and is scratch resistant. The power and volume buttons are placed nicely on the sides where they are rarely accidentally pressed but can be easily pressed when needed. The overall size of the phone is great with it not being too large where you canâ€™t access all of the screen with one hand but is still large enough to easily read any text and watch any videos.
The iPhone 7 also has a new home button that doesnâ€™t physically move like previous iPhoneâ€™s did. Having previously owned an iPhone 6 the button is very different on this new phone but is very easy to get used to. The amount of haptic feedback is adjustable so you can make it feel exactly how you want. After just a few hours with the phone the new home button seemed just as natural as the previous home button. Included in this home button is a fingerprint scanner that is much faster than the scanner in the previous phones.
Although the iPhone 7 was the first iPhone without a headphone jack, it isnâ€™t a large issue for day to day use. There are many Bluetooth headphone options that allow you to listen to music or other media while also charging your phone. Since the phone doesnâ€™t have an audio jack there is another speaker on the bottom that makes the speaker quality much better and louder than previous iPhones.
The front and rear facing cameras on the phone are both very good for their respective tasks. For those looking for a more professional photograph the iPhone 7 plus may be the better option. For the everyday user that isnâ€™t serious into photography they both take very good pictures.
Overall the iPhone is a great improvement from previous generations of iPhones. The overall build quality and design make it a very good looking and durable phone. This phone is great for those who use their phones for everyday communications, playing games, and just about every other task a smart phone can do."
iphone 7,"My phone stopped working 11 days after the warranty! DO NOT BUY. This phone is a ticking time bomb! 11 days after the warrant expired the phone went into a rebooting loop. After spending hours on end with the apple support tech they asked me to go to the nearest apple store. I waited 3 hours for them to plug my phone in and tell me they are going to have to ship the phone off. The stated that I could get an express replacement for over $300. Terrible customer service and the company is loosing touch with quality and customer care! Never buy this product

iphone 7,"The iPhone 7, a giant leap in cellphone technology ...The iPhone 7, a giant leap in cellphone technology? Not quite.
This phone IS advanced but fragile. AppleCare and insurance is a necessity.
Removing the headphone jack seems to have caused some major problems. It is a fragile little flower of a cell phone. Yes it might be waterproof, but that doesn't help if it does not work.
I have been loyal apple user for years and yet within 30 days I am awaiting my second replacement iPhone 7 - on the first phone the charging port (and headphone port now) failed and actually pushed the cable out (ghost in the machine?). That was in the first week - it was replaced and the Second phone lasted 14 days before the same port failed completely. No headphones. No charging. No backing up!! Big bummer!!
It's not Steve Job's apple anymore but I can't see another device that appeals!!!"
iphone 7,"No headphone jack? Fail.'ve had Apple iPhone's for years, and I only own Apple computers and iPads, but I hate this iPhone7 so much I think I'll try turning it back in and getting an iPhone 6. This is my problem: I teach fitness classes at a dozen different gyms all with different sound systems, and because the iPhone doesn't have a headphone jack, I can no longer connect to their sound system. Yes, the iPhone came with an adapter, but that 2 inch adapter was quickly lost with all the running around that I do. SO, I bought a dozen inexpensive adapters from China to have plenty of extras on hand (about $1 each as opposed to the Apple price of $9) but when I plug them in, they work for about 10 seconds, then they stop working with a message on my iPhone that says something like, ""This accessory is not supported."" This whole situation has become an expensive, inconvenient mess for me. It seems that with the new iPhone, I cannot easily charge and listen to my headphones at the same time, and that if I lose my headphone adapter I'm forced to buy the expensive iPhone brands. Someone told me that they got rid of the headphone jacks so that people would be forced to by the blue tooth ear buds. Apple! This is a disaster for me, and it really does appear that you engineered this inconvenience just to sell more accessories. How about thinking about what would be most convenient for your customers, who are paying $800 for an iPhone?"
iphone 7,"Screw this phone!!!!Grrrrr! I hate so much about this new phone!!
I hate that they did away with the head phone jack! It's so annoying. I'm not getting my voicemails, and it's the glitchyest iPhone yet. I've been an iPhone lover for more than 7 years! And now I'm thinking about the pixel ðŸ˜ 
Booo Apple boo!"
iphone 7,"Worth the money. I would just like to share that when Apple says the phone is water resistant, they mean it. The thing still works after being submerged in about 5 feet of water for almost an hour. It was still playing music down there and started chiming with emails as soon as I fished it out of there."
iphone 7,Get rid of bottom screen toolbar. Apple needs to get rid of that gray toolbar aka dock aka crap on the bottom of screen. I have iPhone 7 and it's so much money for nearly diminished 1/4 part of screen

Phone crashes constantly even when using the latest updates. ....Phone crashes constantly even when using the latest updates. Also the removal of the 3.5mm jack is a real pain in the neck when trying to charge your phone while driving and you want to listen to music but your car is too cheap to come with Bluetooth"
iphone 7,"Don't Buy the Hype.I bought this mistake in August after hearing all the hype about the need to have an I phone. Big mistake. I am now stuck with an over priced piece of crap tha for the next two year. I would have less issues if this phone for the money included high quality material .three weeks after I bought it it slipped off the coffee table 18 inches high A ND THE SCREEN CRACKED! I then found out their was only one Apple Store in Tucson. Once I finally got there they want to charge 129 dollars for replacement glass. After s few heated words turn out they realized I had insurance -- so only 29 dollars please and even though I had an appointment there would be several hours of wait time. By the way we have fine selection an Apple labeled junk for you to look at and max your credit card out on while you wait. I asked if they would please install the screen cover I had brought with me.. They said yes, then several hours later when I got back my repaired apple I was asked to wait another 20 minutes, then approached and told Apple does not install third party equipment, but they could sell me a protector and install it - for 39 dollars. I left in disgust.
So far the list of apps recommended for Apple aren't available, I can't import my music, and there's no such thing as an working app. Siri sucks. My bar strength has gone from four bars to two if I'm Lucky. Bleck!!! Buy and Android!

iphone 7,"Mediocare phone.
Honestly I'm disappointed... I can't believe I paid $800 + for this.. It's just not worth it.. This should be no more than $500 the most. IPhones are way overrated and overpriced.. Anyway I returned the phone."
iphone 7,"Great for Photography. he iPhone 7 isn't much of an improvement from the six but, it's all the difference if like to frequently take pictures. The camera I've noticed is easier to focus with and is high quality. Also, the 128 GB storage is very convenient for pictures and videos so you don't get the "" not enough storage "" notification while downloading an app or taking a video.

iphone 7,"Great Phone
As a person who's has Androids for a long time, I was finally convinced to try an iPhone. I got the 7 and I must say that it is great! The only complaint I have is the lack of headphone jack. The adapter is fine when you can remember to bring it/use it. Overall, great phone and I think I'll be sticking around with iPhone for awhile."
iphone 7,"Five Stars.
Love my iPhone 7 plus.. great sound quality, battery life and camera!! No complaints"
iphone 7,"iPhone 7 review, iPhone 7
Each year, Apple Inc. launches a better version of the iPhone into the market. I agree, the iPhone 7 is the highest preforming smartphone in the market to date. The A10 Fusion chip, whose function is to power the iPhone 7, is comprised of four distinct cores: two low-energy cores designed for easier tasks while ensuring low power usage and two high-performance cores to handle the most intense tasks. When testing my iPhone 7, I noticed that it had an internal storage of 128GB and the speed of some personal computers. The phone is ideal for university students who are always on the go and store everything on their phones. This is a pretty big deal since one of the biggest issues with the iPhone's was storage.
Design
The iPhone 7 has an elegant new design that comes in five finishes, silver, gold, rose gold, black, and jet black. The black finish is characterized by an anodized matte look. The jet black finish is consummated through anodization and innovative polish, perfecting its glossy finish. An exclusively and perfectly reengineered enclosure makes the phone water resistant while offering maximum protection against dust, spills, or even splashes.
Screen
The iPhone 7 screen is more improved as compared to iPhone 6s, which makes it comfortable for the user even in the harsh midday glare. For instance, I can comfortably read an article in the sunlight using my phone. Also, the screen is capable of supporting a wider gamut of color, making videos, as well as photos to pop with saturated and vivacious hue.
Apps
Launching Apps on the iPhone 7 is quicker than other Smartphones. Its processor works very fast and is capable of running high graphic games and supporting convoluted photo-editing applications. The iPhone's battery is capable of lasting longer than a day when used normally.
Camera
The iPhone 7 is built with a single 12-megapixel iSight camera whose performance is incomparable to that of the iPhone 6s. The aperture lens of this phone is wider, f1.8, allowing penetration of more light, making it possible to take better photos in the dark or low-light. The iPhone 7 is comprised of an optical image stabilizer that was initially limited to only superior Plus Smartphone models. Also, the phone has a TrueTone flash which is brighter when compared to that of iPhone 6s. The color of the photos is remarkable on the iPhone 7 due to the P3 color gamut. Its distinctive features, such as the iOS 10 can allow a third-party application to effectively access RAW data from its iSight camera. All these features put the iPhone 7 at the top of the list when it comes to smartphones."
iphone 7,"Brilliant for New users , but nothing special for iphone 6/6 plus owners. I ordered this phone from official Apple store.
Let me tell you my story, i was android dude and i kinda hated Iphone , you know why ? because people keep buying them not because of needs but for being more fashionable or being popular among the friends or general community.
I upgraded my phone from samsung galaxy s5 and i had a choice :
1. Samung galaxy s7
2. Iphone 7
I checked every forum on the internet and it was really hard for me to make this decision really . Mostly i appreciate phones specifications and the only thing in which samsung was better was the screen resolution ( i dont really need 2k display -_-) and camera which needs some kind of knowledge to take good pictures but iphone is more like easier.
I did not buy iphone 7 plus because it is far too big for me and my pocket .
I like phone itself but ios system is not comfortable for me , because android has way too much freedom , but i won't write less than 5 stars because of my tastes about ios system.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY GOT IPHONE 6 or 6 PLUS IF YOU REALLY BUY PHONE FOR ITS SPECIFICATIONS OR FEATURES DON't UPGRADE , I HAD A LOT OF TIME WITH IPHONE 6 AND THERE IS WAY TOO SMALL AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCES.

PERSONALLY I THINK THAT NOBODY SHOULD UPGRADE PHONE EVERY YEAR OR 2 TIMES PER YEAR. AIN'T NO COMPANY UPGRADES THEIR GADGETS 1-2 TIMES PER YEAR SO THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY NEED UPGRADE SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF IT. WAIT 1-2 YEAR AND THEN GO UPGRADE

UPDATE ###1 : i get used to it, phone works perfectly and seems very fast. I like it and maybe i won't change it :)"
iphone 7,Five stars. Great Phone.
iphone 7,Switching to Galaxy for reasons.  have been using iphone for past 5 years. iphone4 for 3 yrs and then iphone 6 for past 2 yrs. Each phone's ringtone and any clicking sound stop working after about 2 years of use. No damage caused by me at all. When I called Apple they said it's out of warranty and it would cost about $300 to replace or repair the phone. This happened for both iphone. I read the book Steve Jobs and I realized Apple's strategy is to integrate everything and hard to repair them. I think they don't care about customer's burden for repair. I am definitely switching to Galaxy for my next smart phone. Strongly recommend not to use iphone.
