iPhone 8 ,One Star . FAKE IPHONE! BE AWARE
iPhone 8,One Star.I loved my phone until it stopped working after two weeks will never order from this seller again
iPhone 8,"The product was brand new and authentic. However, the description says the phone is unlocked, but when I received the device, it was connected to the T-Mobile carrier"
iPhone 8,"Worked perfectly.Ordered â€œLike Newâ€, unlocked 256gb iPhone 8 from meow-tronics. Came without the original box, as described, with an original Apple charging block and cable. Phone had some barely noticeable wear on the corner of the screen, but is otherwise perfect. Worked fine when I transferred my SIM card from iPhone SE on MetroPCS. Definitely would recommend buying from this seller."
iPhone 8,"I bought an iphone 8 that clearly says fully unlocked and I got a blocked phone, I am now out of the USA and I have tried to send the equipment and it has become impossible, I am not at all happy or satisfied, this purchase is a disaster, I can do?"

iPhone 8,"zero. hi sr. my iphone 8 suddenly restart when i play in facebook, instagram, and my camera doesn't work"
iPhone 8,Five Stars. Arrived on time and as expected
iPhone 8,"iPhone 8 is superior to iPhone X. I originally purchased an iPhone X but after 10 days the novelty wore off, and I switched it for the iPhone 8. Hereâ€™s why.

Touch ID on the iPhone 8 is faster and easier to use than Face ID - and enables me to open my phone before it leaves my pocket. I was also worried about the impact of Face ID which beams infrared laser dots into my eyes 30 times a day (10,000 times a year).

I prefer the rectangular screen of the 8 to the one on the X with its curved corners and weird inset.

Best of all, I can orientate my iPhone 8 simply by feeling the touch ID button - even in the dark or in a pocket. I can also see exactly how much battery percentage I have left, and closing apps is a snap compared to the X.

The iPhone 8 is brilliant - it's fast, simple and familiar to use. By comparison, the iPhone X feels gimmicky because its so-called innovations make it harder to use."
iPhone 8,One Star. the phone was not working and it was not unlocking.
iPhone 8,DONT BUY the iphone 8 isnt as water proof as you think i bought one and took it under water following the guidlines for wayer use and my charging isnt working as well and the water can damage the speakers
iPhone 8,One Star. Missing item
iPhone 8,"Wish I hadn't upgraded from 6s. I traded up from a 6s ,and I wished I hadn't.It's constantly freezing.I switch to numerals or caps, and I tap and tap ,nothing happens.Not everytime ,but enough to annoy me.There are a lot of minor inconveniences to numerous to mention.I'm on Sprint ."
iPhone 8,Four Stars. It is what I expected.
iPhone 8,"VOID SCAM. Do not buy, came scratched and got in a boot loop after 2 weeks of using. would never buy again"
iPhone 8,"Constantly updates new features that I cannot turn off or remove. Software update descriptions do not accurately describe new features added to the phone. Initial purchase includes all of Apple's features turned on by default. Just really irritated I have a computer I own and pay the complete price of, and I have no say in what is downloaded unto my phone."
iPhone 8,"i'm commenting just like them. Iphones are reliable and have a nice. I will be sincere. Since there are many Android fans here and nobody removes their worthless reviews, i'm commenting just like them.
Iphones are reliable and have a nice camera. PERIOD."
iPhone 8,Five Stars. Good
iPhone 8,One Star. Bad
iPhone 8,Four Stars. Excellent phone
iPhone 8,Great phone! Excellent purchase. I have Verizon and everything worked great. Much cheaper than brand new!

iPhone 8,Five Stars. Excellent
iPhone 8,doesn't not work. first of all the phone itself looks weird. I'm not sure if it locked or no but it did not work with Verizon
iPhone 8,"This phone is incredibly overpriced. The only reason I purchased it is because it was a gift for a dear friend who had a 5 year old I phone 5 and although these phones tend to give you four years of good usage and be relatively high quality, the price is absolutely ridiculous and id never buy one myself. Id give it two stars if they didnt last as long as they tend to, but id rather keep buying my 100 dollar unlocked Android smartphones from walmart every four years and save myself a ton cash."
iPhone 8,"Died after a month, no support from Apple.After a month of use, it bricked itself overnight. Wouldn't take a charge, wouldn't respond to any input, wouldn't respond to the side button or the hard reset combo. As if that wasn't bad enough, I tried to make an appointment at the local Apple store to get it looked at, they had a TEN DAY wait.

Lesson learned: Don't buy an Apple phone if you want any level of support from the manufacturer."
iPhone 8,"Go for it... It's an apple. Apple the brand name itself reassures u that the product will be worthy of every penny u spend... I am not an applE user yet I have seen alot of my frnds who use apple ... 4 , 5 ,6 ,7 ,8... All of then are proud of owning one , not only proud but also happy to be using one. The performance apple pack is every time 5 years ahead of its competitors . I being an Android user ,  is without doubt unhappy. I find apple the best over any of its leading competitors . They may boast of more gbs, MPs , but u can just simply say it's not an APPLE.  4s can do better than many of the android phones............ If u have the bucks go for apple. Nothing else.... Even it's resale value is great that u can upgrade to the newest apple the next yeaR without much trouble if u r a tech savvy...

Simply go for it.....

Waiting for the day , when I will also buy one.....

Ya maybe A 13s ... "
iPhone 8,"Same Old..same old! Really Apple?! I checked it out and played with it. There is nothing at all â€œdifferentâ€ about this iPhone then an iPhone 4...from what...2009?
How is this innovation? I donâ€™t understand it. I have owned iPhones, windows phones, and android phones over my life. Android and YEAH WINDOWS phones have MADE HUGE improvements...what the F has Apple done? Iâ€™m over Apple and theyâ€™re over hyped nonsense phones! Google or windows now! The pixel 2 ...Samsung...and Windows lumia 950 or Hp Elite X3...ALL DESTROY this iphone!
Apples software is outdated...ugly...boring...and behind the times now! Apple needs a complete makeover...and an actual new â€œTHINGâ€...believe me...â€one last thingâ€...it is NOT!!!"
iPhone 8,Total Garbage. Horrible product right out of the box. Going back to Samsung
